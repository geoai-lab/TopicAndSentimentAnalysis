Allerton_1f416b6c-f54a-4445-b9d7-06462ca76aa0,"The area is relatively nice and quiet. A great place for someone to live and a nice quiet atmosphere. Every day needs are generally in walking distance like supermarket, laundry, various corner markets, etc"

Allerton_9b7abec8-6b63-4faf-9581-fe2b4e09c193,"the good thing is it is a multicultural area, and with proper services implemented, it could be resurrected"
Allerton_bf43292c-4f39-4bda-9c77-600cfadb0fba,"Great neighborhood if you are tired of the crazy NYC life. Tons of houses around so it is a change of scenery to the buildings you see in the city."
Allerton_43bd8cc7-a26f-466a-847e-adc26ca72677,"One of my biggest problems is the filth in the area. It getting annoying when you clean then some one messing up your front walk way."

Allerton_7dc419a5-f4c2-4f2b-aabc-9ced0147caad,"Isn't as bad as it seems,they are opportunities."
Allerton_0a869fb6-70cf-433a-a846-974e44ccccd5,"As it's recognized the community that i am currently in does need some improvements, but at the same time it may be hard to find such a unique community with all that it got during this time period in the U.S."
Allerton_043e4842-31ce-4b33-9e69-5f2d2b3c9d5d,"the area is generally safe"
Allerton_04812b56-a3cf-4a76-86fc-8e8dd4311cdd,"the weather here is moderately okay"
Allerton_4ba199a9-148e-4d6c-8c70-2e753ae2cc7e,"The jobs in my area are more focused on the educational/ qualificational aspect than just giving people a chance to learn and pick up on the qualifications needed for the job"
Allerton_e4145894-2ec3-438f-bc27-f02596ec2b85,"Some of the smaller stores are good at remembering customers. The bigger stores are generally more busy and get alot of visitors"
Allerton_f470eb3d-9779-436e-85d7-24bad0864b1e,"This neighborhood consists of mostly apartment buildings."
Allerton_e103e115-4149-4ca8-8269-9dbd753c6f59,"The people in this area a  very diverse and very accepting of each other."
Allerton_d4baa11e-bca9-4a66-acf5-84d22b23ec3c,"You really do not have to go far to get almost anything you need."
Allerton_15da35ad-7ac6-43b8-b3d3-8d30de1e8e7c,"The average fast foods are located in the area.  There is one Cuban restaurant and one Spanish restaurant."

Allerton_698035c8-28ee-4bf9-9de6-43a3d3eb96a9,"This is a residential area and jobs are limited."

Allerton_38c27a30-1bc0-4466-a893-5bd886e49906,"Improvement needed in this area. In general, a majority of the restaurants are fast food chains or two cultural cuisines. The food is basically the same in the area."
Allerton_28121c44-32c4-4ae1-97de-9225c4a87438,"State representation is okay, could be better. Law enforcement is on time."
Allerton_42934807-6700-4fb2-a35b-65cc187cc6f8,"The most popular thing to do in this area is shop, however, many people go to Manhattan instead, but that might change given the new mall that is about to open. The next most popular event is The Bronx Zoo and Botanical Garden."
Allerton_479e3b45-b11b-4e26-8989-c8f6007e0620,"I am not too certain about property cost and best/worst areas of living."
Allerton_72c4b9a6-3ced-4144-901d-0c7460f81836,"The familiarity of the inhabitants is what makes the community strong. We do have a mix of many types of people but over a while we become like a mosaic. There are Afro-Caribbeans, Latinos, Middle Eastern, Asian. But the majority are Afro-Caribbeans and Latinos."
Allerton_162b9aeb-0e42-4e81-8b18-c0ef083e11e6,"I see minor appropriate improvement where need be. The sense of community and comfort would make me live here again."
Allerton_88d0cf54-f234-4748-812a-f85457a68a82,"For the busy areas that we have, transportation and safety are controlled well. Rarely do we have incidents and recently the district has been doing things to resolve that such as installing traffic signals, reducing roads to one lane/bike lane/parking lane/turn bay which has made a tremendous difference."
Allerton_1fed258f-8a77-4880-b617-76459c760f4b,"Within the past few years they have been cleaning up parks so I suppose they have been doing a good job to take care of the environmental conditions in the area."
Allerton_20bdd0e2-bf6e-49c8-844a-cbd4ee69b3b1,"Many people in this area are friendly and know each other good enough. It is a family environment considering that many of us have been here for years."
Allerton_1bc3afc0-d279-44d8-86fd-0df3ac1ec112,"In the area, the police department have enforced new regimes to keep criminals and loitering at a low by a certain time. One can find a police vehicle on the end of each busy road at night. It seems a bit excessive since other areas of the Bronx need that protection more than this area, but there is a visible affect since people are no longer on the streets at a certain point."
Allerton_41997ff7-8f8a-47ef-9798-f55ea014e630,"A new mall is being developed which will supply work. There is a range of employment from self-employed, day-to-day workers to bankers, doctors, and teachers."
Allerton_d6f0386f-a56a-4713-9047-5f85ab36704f,"There are gymnasiums in the area, but not many of the older folks utilize them. However, on average you can find many people doing yard work. Although we have no healthy restaurants, due to the Caribbean cultures, one can find that many people eat their cultural health foods. Thus the conditions are okay."
Allerton_644e3975-42bc-4789-9344-34e5c6a25436,"lot of apartments but other than that it is great"
Allerton_a14f716f-96ef-4702-8906-423ac04166c5,"not really much negative stuff you could say"
Allerton_67df5938-c27a-4ad4-a9bd-a549f6512417,"its not many jobs here that i can find"
Allerton_63c45b35-4b42-4eaa-924c-d8cbbacace6d,"Close housing. Attached houses here."
Allerton_ccd3c1c8-a918-4f82-8f59-5e540926d445,"The job options are available, people just have to look for them."
Allerton_b5be5594-1ec9-4324-b1cd-020764fc21ff,"Royal Coach Dinner is a great place to eat! The staff are great and the food is good. Customer service is their priority."
Arden Heights_6956850d-04bd-4739-8e7c-e050031a0449,"There aren't many abandoned buildings in the area"
Arden Heights_17603cc6-b7a7-4739-8635-b04ea6d5bdb6,"People tend to move out of the area and I want to."
Arden Heights_d47bc48e-c954-4e0c-8e95-e6d60adb1ef6,"I have never noticed any crime in my area"
Arden Heights_7c9f0dae-283e-41eb-b3f8-aef0e3011e87,"There is crime, but it could be worse"

Arden Heights_fb1045e4-e915-42a4-8fcd-590f6cb4d796,"Staten island is a very average and boring place to live."
Arden Heights_448b0187-2383-420e-8b7b-3dee9736dcf4,"I live in a safe neighborhood with little to no crime."
Arden Heights_25628cb5-d655-44f3-aded-02ce57327600,"good atmosphere, nice people, good stores"
Arden Heights_3816d8fe-7ed0-46ec-a1a1-d8ce7aed7123,"I would never choose to live here because of pollution and littering everywhere and terrible transportation for those with no car or license."
Arden Heights_68fe57bc-d0f9-44f1-b33a-959384a98f50,"Local parks provide a peaceful scenery with trails and wildlife."
Arden Heights_7d1cab2b-69f2-45d0-be8d-3902ea05f95b,"The homes are well kept for the most part and families take pride in how they take care of their homes and renovate them for upping purposes."
Arden Heights_fc6c362a-3f11-4ea5-94f2-1d0290c8ba1d,"People tend to move here and enjoy the area since it is quiet, peaceful, clean, well kept, and the aesthetic values are nice as well."
Arden Heights_19e99c31-f229-455e-80e6-d492d4679efb,"The crime rate here is low and not many crimes are heard of especially in this area so it is not much of a concern at all."
Arden Heights_8d9d8103-597b-405b-94d9-18291add9ebc,"At times, it is either really cold or really hot. The summers are perfect regarding temperature and winters vary. At times, the snowstorms can be continuous and dreadfully cold and bitter."
Arden Heights_5bf9b83a-b89f-4259-9cca-d2e1d307d2d6,"The restaurants here are of a wide variety including Applebees, Panera, TGI Fridays, Outback, Z One, Z Two, Chinese, Japanese, Pizza places, Italian Food, Helath food shops, Ice cream Stores, Sandwich places, etc."
Arden Heights_600d9d10-ec82-4eab-8ed0-93eb4d13df9d,"I believe the employment is okay. For some, it is easier to find jobs due to their degree they have or past experience. For others, it may be more difficult given their current situation and maybe not easy access to the job field they want without certain prior experience."
Arden Heights_5acf124e-e593-40cb-a1d0-ae982fdc1ec7,"The local business have a wide range of products and are usually a one stop shop in that going to a larger supermarket is not needed 99% of the time if you are already at a smaller shop."
Arrochar_d76254f7-e437-4d28-9250-ba43f4dd5f97,"Barely any crimes at all."
Arrochar_8bead24c-7c03-4483-b04e-c4c185cad547,"Good neighborhood. Barely any crimes at all. Very quiet and friendly neighbors."
Arrochar_d9eb994a-53ae-401b-b951-055a78e4ba79,"Staten Island has nothing to do for kids. The roads are in bad shape and it is overcrowded."
Arrochar_7498406f-be12-42eb-8c76-7c3ccc964fb5,"There is a variety of stores and some restaurants."
Arrochar_1d568cef-e0e9-4416-a581-2854a3f12146,"There is a beach where I live so when it is a warm day it will look nice."
Arrochar_a5f997b8-279c-4455-bf4b-7793ee2857c6,"There would be loud arguments on the streets at least once a month but nothing serious and crime related."
Arrochar_52f56663-8630-482b-ac9b-38d95c300ebe,"Easy access to NYC, Brooklyn, and New Jersey. Good opportunities in health care."
Arrochar_94e4dd57-c6f6-4668-bd95-930043a07867,"Urban area. Businesses are plentiful just hit or miss."
Arverne_105cbefc-4fcd-4199-9770-d764671036f4,"I live in the area. They should make jobs more readily available for the youth. I would also encourage clean and safe playgrounds to include actual basketball hoops and not just the ring"
Arverne_46695cde-3d5e-49af-b87d-057b917cbe9c,"I like the fact the it is now less violent then in the previous 5 years and also that it is under reconstruction. It is now becoming more family oriented."
Arverne_efa02cd8-f279-4dc8-a2e4-8c1af54c4878,"I've been living in Arverne for three years. A lot of changes has to be done. After hurricane Sandy, there were many damages. I appreciate the things that were fixed such as the beach and trains. The buildings are the main problem. People sometimes never help themselves. Our floors are never cleaned and maintenance comes once a month. The sanitary in the lobby is appalling."
Arverne_c444214d-d77c-4e24-a257-112399eac666,"The community is filled with many public schools and community centers for the youth. There are several restaurants in the area that offer a wide variety of foods such as Chinese, Jamaican cuisine, Italian etc. There aren't many options for 'healthy living' such as whole food markets. The commute is extensive and far away from the other boroughs. "
Arverne_68dc1e75-fafd-49c7-a5c9-4e121a5d3dac,"I enjoy where I live . It's a quiet calm neighborhood by the beach near family and friends. It's near New York City for jobs and easy access to public transportation."
Arverne_89473f5a-f9c4-4acf-92ab-e7c04c099403,"The people do not engage in community activities."
Arverne_8ea3b45c-0492-4ea5-8306-d4fcdbb0faff,"My neighborhood has been neglected by the city."
Arverne_94e1d859-6507-4ceb-91fe-239ac0e77e87,"the streets are being repaired and it's taking forever. We aren't allowed on most of the beach. the houses are bad.."
Arverne_4f9bedb2-904b-4cbd-aafa-0ecfec8c3453,"its okay

not too loud

niether is it quiet 

could be a little safer"
Arverne_fd06d9b7-e77b-4adc-a2d2-cfa1767e12ea,"the housing areas are fine. the projects can be a little better but other than that everything else is fine.   the people are take care of their homes. most of the people are hiome owners."
Arverne_d4931682-0845-49f5-83d3-0499e979106d,"not that many crimes go on in my neighborhood."
Arverne_24ea71de-68db-45d2-a88b-b5ca892a2142,"our community members are great when we need help we help out and look out for one another sometimed it might be a little messy but we get most of the work done."
Arverne_f8e04d80-e257-4f51-af25-5dd88c65bda7,"although we only has one major weather misfortune which was hurricane sandy everything else weather wise is great."
Arverne_d00cf8d4-a54e-41ea-a40e-4c781eb1c463,"the area has come up since I moved into the rockaways. The food chains has brought a lot of positive energy into the living environment since a lot of kids are not fortunate enough to go to places such as tai restaurants its great to have kids be able to go to these restaurants."
Arverne_750d166d-6e9a-43f0-84a3-5cae71c8e33b,"due to the people in my neighborhood their is a lack of teens knowing about job oppturnities."
Arverne_5dba889c-a90d-4d1c-82d9-a1c3ab2deb1d,"The business stores in my neighborhood is okay. they do have their times where they do fall short and are not as clran as they can be but they are doing a fair job"
Arverne_9ff00cb5-ac9d-47bd-8cca-066f9f529b9b,"I want to move somewhere else as soon as possible."
Arverne_65a5fb3d-7b3f-487e-b3cf-cccafe742c28,"I think the local businesses are okay. Obviously because of the surrounding area, it is going to have a bad vibe to it, but I am use to it by now."
Arverne_35815279-7c1a-4ef1-a605-bfd1efbda2e5,"There are people with positive attitudes but for the most part that is not the case. I know the reason is beacause they are struggling too much, that they don't have the ability to put up a fake smile and help others. I understand why people are negative. In a class I took, I learned about maslow's hierarchy of needs which list needs in order and saying that people can't move up a level unless their basic needs are met. Based off of that concept, it proves that people can't help each other, and just be happy, until their basic needs are met, which includes, having a stable home, food, and financial security."
Arverne_950f042f-4c80-4863-9303-49f16e1531fb,"When it comes to quality food, the area sucks. Everything is fast food, but being that it is cheap, it is the best option because people can't afford paying for anything else. There are a couple of spots for getting a drink but thats not as important as having a healthy meal everyday for a parent and their children."
Arverne_3a34d060-751d-492f-a923-0c3bbdf3ac86,"People do have jobs here, but I also see alot of homeless people just walking around living on the streets. The jobs offered in the area are jobs that you expect teenagers working at. Instead, these are the same jobs that adults, who have families to feed, and bills to pay, are working at. It's sad that there aren't enough job opportunities out there for people."
Arverne_7a8805dd-981d-4411-a633-462ea1757608,"I hear gunshots at least once a month. I'm sure it is worst in other areas, but being that I'm already use to hearing it, I know that the crime rate is very high here."
Arverne_38a250c5-7506-4ba1-a25b-1a5c5a4d4833,"Some days, the weather can be very bad causing delays in schedules. Other days, the weather is very nice leading to trips to the beach and doing things outside."
Arverne_9f56864c-9b76-4251-b02e-fe3dca1e10eb,"Most people in the area are not currently employed. Most of those who are  work outside of the area."
Arverne_da45f2c8-5ec9-4851-b223-1b3c17e81471,"I really benefit from the local businesses here in Far Rockaway. At times, I even find items that are not available in the popular stores. I also find that the prices at the local stores are cheaper than the other popular stores."
Astoria_5a3c03d8-6e73-4f7c-8058-57987cc89fd3,"Astoria can be described as a family favorite and yet a neighborhood appropriate for all ages. You can find anything and everything, a little manhattan. In the morning you can take a run to Astoria park and enjoy views of the city while taking in  fresh air thanks to the vast green scenery. You can grab lunch on 30 Avenue and Broadway. Astoria offers a variety of foods, local and chain restaurants. Lastly, for an evening out you can find pubs, lounges, and even dance parties! One of the safest places, perfect for families!"
Astoria_faca38f0-f3eb-49a0-b291-dae956dae253,"This is a very young, fun area. Great for students and young professionals. Also family friendly. Real estate is very expensive though. I wish rent was more affordable. If you have roommate then financially it is more convenient. Affording it by yourself can be a little challenging."
Astoria_fa1f704b-04b6-44a6-9f09-d609c443aff5,"Great area with plenty of restaurants and diversity.  Unfortunately is has become gentrified which has raised the costs of living and forced out a lot 'old neighborhood' establishments."
Astoria_bac1d4af-4dd6-4201-9204-893c37799f18,"Astoria is a great and friendly neighborhood. Perks of the neighborhood include great restaurants, nightlife, and small businesses."
Astoria_4a27a3dc-19bc-4e43-9e7b-2a25799d58f1,"It is a  neighborhood with lots of restaurants and bars. They even have 24 hour food delivery service at the diners. Lots of dogs and young people. They have a big astoria park where they have pools opened in the summer."
Astoria_866abb3e-9e7e-4ca0-9e42-91eef06d60c8,"Astoria is a quaint little neighborhood that is also known as Long Island City. My favorite spots to visit are the Astoria Branch Library which looks like a little house, the Museum of the Moving Image, and the Kaufman Studios. There is also the ever scenic view by the East River pathway and Astoria Park. Socrates Sculpture Park also hosts things like yoga, capoeira, and my favorite the farmer's market on Saturdays during the summer. They even have their own quirky pieces of art. There is a wealth of things to do in the neighborhood, and people are relatively friendly."
Astoria_8df9aff6-3faf-455b-95dc-e6f91ecfb4d8,"I've been living here for 4 years and there is a lot I love about it. The community feels safe, I love how close the commute to Manhattan is, my family in jersey is also a short 30 min drive away. Astoria is clean, convienent, diverse and full of bars, restaurants, parks and more."
Astoria_38b092c1-5ca0-4965-b390-cb21dd648a04,"Astoria has become the Williamsburg of Queens.  You can find any type of cuisine from around the world in Astoria.  Parking is not friendly, but there is access to the N/W trains to take you where you need to go.  Businesses are in walking distance of resident life.  Astoria Park is wonderful with a gorgeous view of the city and great place to watch the sunset behind the bridges.  Astoria's school district isn't the best in NYC, but they are above average."
Astoria_978d1315-68aa-4017-9b57-3d6c47ffc040,"Astoria is friendly, lively, and exciting. People come to enjoy the marvelous restaurants, the social people, and beautiful parks."
Astoria_ad6ed65f-4b53-4fd3-a3fc-2259cc26b74f,"Astoria is a neighborhood with the perfect mix of great food, diverse culture, charm/character, and safety.   Conveniently located about 20 minutes from midtown Manhattan (by public transport or car), it is perfect for commuters who want to be away from the hustle & bustle of NYC."
Astoria_8c760c5b-6741-41c9-8488-e43a8d19229b,"Born and raised in Astoria, and couldnt have thanked my parents more! I love Astoria, super close to Manhattan and great diversity. Everything is so convenient and every one living in Astoria is  a little family. A very close community."
Astoria_2cf32947-399e-4f0d-81ad-ebea38cc7c95,"I love living in Astoria.  It has been my home for 7 years.  It is warm, friendly and active with great restaurants.  The apartments are spacious and you have everything you need within a few blocks."
Astoria_239b489d-d4ba-4766-b73e-4a7af1d7ad5f,"Astoria, New York is a family friendly VERY diverse neighborhood! There are tons of different types of restaurants.  With the subway so close Manhattan is only 15 minutes away!"

Astoria_dad3a7c3-7b9c-4ffc-8256-97c7b7fea910,"I love my neighborhood! Astoria is one of the most eclectic neighborhoods that NYC has to offer! The food is incredible and incredibly diverse. Visit the Museum of Moving Image to learn about the history of cinema and the neighboring Kaufman Studios. Then stroll to eat at any number of restaurants to brunch it up! Burn off those calories walking to Socraties'Sculpture park and bask in the warmth of the sun while browsing the outdoor art exhibits."
Astoria_da408cc0-54f2-4e1d-8f86-1434dcc8be17,"I've lived in Astoria for three years. I absolutely love the neighborhood and all it offers. I still go back to visit with my old roommate and hit up some of the local eateries. My experiences there in Astoria will always remain to close my heart. After all I was fortunate enough to meet the love of my life there."
Astoria_ea70b1a2-3f01-4c7b-96f8-44bdb446d7ce,"I have lived in Astoria almost all my life. It's a quiet and lively neighborhood all at once. There are places to go,eat, drink, hangout, and parks to spend time at. It's just 20 minutes from Manhattan, and although the area is getting filled with young professionals, its Greek roots still remain."
Astoria_83536b7d-bd43-42c9-abf9-224c28a05b29,"Astoria is great place tor reside. The more interesting part about Astoria, is the diverse population. Here people can experience different cultures, languages and religions. The transportation is also great. It is located in advantageous place where commute is easy to all boroughs of New York City. There are also all type of restaurants meaning Asians, Middle Eastern, European, American, South Americans and central Americans. The only problem can be the raise in the rents."
Astoria_a33b94bf-8011-487c-b758-dd49fe03f2ca,"I like pretty much everything about Astoria. The only thing I don't like is how many people are moving in and driving up rent because they don't realize how much rent should be in Astoria, and now some huge buildings are going up that aren't in the style or spirit of the neighborhood. It's not a big party neighborhood but I like that it is all families."
Astoria_aaa15810-baac-42a4-bcf2-96fe7b1021e2,"Astoria is the best place to be. I absolutely adore this neighborhood. Everything you need will be there. It is the ideal location for anyone - a student, a family, adults, or even elders. The train station is 5 minutes away from my house, there's a supermarket 10 minutes away, a middle school, 2 elementary schools, 2 high schools, grocery stores, restaurants, and just about anything! You name it, we have it! I also love some of the aesthetic views in Astoria, especially on the train! It may not have huge buildings or skyscrapers, but just the simple houses are enough to make my heart melt. I have a connection with this city, and I am so glad that I can live here."
Astoria_dc6ba78c-1645-46a2-bc8a-4f0182cbc445,"I like Astoria because you can find everything in every corner, no need to go to the city, and have many amenities year round, as well as 24 hours services like supermarket, Pharmacy, ans restaurants to name a few."
Astoria_c3ee40a7-aa98-4f8f-819a-9c91716fb736,"Astoria is a great place to live in and even nearby because of the convenience they have everything you may need is at reach. Including most modes of common transportation. The only thing that may be lacking would be the pricing/ living cost because of how everything is so close the prices are a stake of being quite high."
Astoria_604e558c-2aaf-4a0d-916a-ecaa17133603,"It's a wonderful, intergenerational, multi-cultural neighborhood. Delicious food from all around the world. Affordable rent for reasonable spaces."
Astoria_46406642-be47-4f8b-98cc-20121730c1a6,"Astoria Park is great, with a newly bike lane and beautiful waterfront view. I highly recommend it during warm months as a place to exercise, run or even walk around. The sunset by the water is stunning. Neighborhood is safe and clean. Close to major subway stations. There are good and affordable restaurants everywhere."
Astoria_00e447ca-96c7-4c58-b7e6-3906b4c8b6f3,"Pretty exciting place to be. Always a lot of things happening. Nightlife is the best around Broadway and Steinway Street. Lots of varieties in restaurants, probably could eat in a different place everyday for years. But with this increasing variety comes the gentrification, which is making it harder for us not-so-rich people to live in the neighborhood."
Astoria_abe52c87-0340-4daf-8027-15de32287b85,"Astoria NY is such a clean and lovely place to live, everything in this area is full of beauty from Astoria park which is accompanied with a stunning view of the east river and the Hells gate and R.F.K. bridge to the old school looking houses . Astoria feels like its the center of NY to me because it is very easy and quick to get to the surrounding boroughs and Manhattan is only a few stops away on a single train. The diversity of culture is also a great feature of astoria where there's endless amounts and varieties of international food and also a few classic american diners."
Astoria_67c68063-9f82-41da-aba7-5ea69abedbbe,"I love Astoria . It's a diverse community , with so much culture and love it brings a smile to my face to be apart of such a different community. We have many different restaurants, shopping areas , and we are just minutes away from the city. I personally lived in Astoria all of my childhood and I must say , I always felt safe and secure. Astoria is also know for its creative art work we display on certain store gates, there's community service going on all the time. Astorians always find away to give back to the community whether it's painting bridges or cleaning parks , Astoria is filled with loving caring citizens."
Astoria_03322179-e2b0-4ab8-9d88-ae4cb16fca73,"Astoria, Queens is a very interesting neighborhood.  Although Astoria is traditionally a Greek, Italian hamlet, it is very diverse in culture. Any type of food you want, you will find in Astoria. The real estate is great as well! Just three years ago a studio would go for $1350, the same studio would be $1675!, Some apartments have great views of the Manhattan skyline! There are plenty of bars and restaurants and local mom and pop shops within walking distance and if you ever wanted to venture into 'the city',  It is about 20 minutes to midtown by the subway! Astoria is a great place to live! Still, the charm of Sunday stoop sales, and walks in Astoria park are enough to keep me there! A true neighborhood gem! Thank you, Astoria for being so awesome!"
Astoria_2d4cafc5-09f3-4108-b6d8-20ce7805c0e6,"Astoria is filled with so many different cultures that almost every street has something that represents a culture."
Astoria_3b2c265d-afc9-42df-bebe-7eb0851a288d,"There is so much diversity in Astoria. You can walk around Steinway Street and go from Egyptian, and Turkish restaurants and cafes to Greek, to Colombian, all within a couple of blocks. The subway runs well and its very close to the city too."
Astoria_0172f264-5192-42d5-a606-dab038afe25a,"Very diverse and multicultural. Great food choices, with many authentic food options available. You can explore any culture you want regarding food, traditions, holidays, language, etc."
Astoria_74ed6b45-c8fd-4efe-8f5f-34a7e7c9725b,"The neighborhood is fairly quiet, affordable, and safe. The access to public transportation could be improved. "
Astoria_3d73661b-76fa-4ebf-bbb6-ca9af60fb1d0,"My neighborhood is changing rapidly. There has been a large group of people who can't afford to live in Brooklyn moving here. That means a lot of new stores and restaurants and a new energy but it also means more crowded streets and subways and very expensive houses. Many of my friends, who have also grown up here, won't be able to afford to stay here when we graduate from college."
Astoria_8c9c5389-41f6-4404-91d0-b87f14bcdac7,"I love the neighborhood. Very safe and calm place to live in. Transportation nearby. I literally don't imagine myself living some place else. The only cons is that rent is expensive."
Astoria_7df8095b-f1b2-47d3-b4f8-638a404f8c9b,"The community of Astoria is very friendly. It is an international melting pot. It is friendly. It has full access to public transportation. It is very close to the New York Borough of Manhattan, New York city. there are many young adults living here."
Astoria_f162d61f-4c08-4743-a2ce-73ef9d9b8bdd,"The prevalence of crimes in Astoria is low. This area is safe. The police presence is highly visible. I have no crime or safety concern for Astoria."
Astoria_bb86044b-4ae5-4eb6-8d3c-4b7ff5e10388,"I have live in Astoria Queens since 1980. I have lived in other parts of New York City, but I have settled down in Astoria because I love the safe lifestyle here.  It is an up and coming City, with a lot of young individuals living here, which is affordable and close to New York City of Manhattan. There are many different cultures living in Astoria. I love this diversity to see the world from a few blocks away. There are many neighborhood diners and many landmarks to visit."

Astoria_cee453fc-a7ec-4b45-a8ff-9911551bb37c,"Absolutely love living in this diverse neighborhood where transportation, restaurants, and nightlife are all within easy walking distance."
Astoria_fe4ff8aa-6585-4a10-8f27-da5a36c7821c,"I personally do not like Queens because of the traffic, there are a lot of nasty people and the tightness. You do not have a lot of personal space, everything, meaning the buildings, are too close too each other. I prefer to live in Long Island because it is peaceful and you have your personal space. The only bad thing about Long Island is that you have to drive every where."
Astoria_869412fd-cb5a-4baa-8391-8a2cdd6d27b6,"The housing are great overall, however, can be too expensive for some if they don't have job with good pay. The exterior may look the same for most houses, but the interior are always excellently designed."
Astoria_a3b6eae0-caac-423b-b535-57966c06b7df,"Everyone is friendly and occasionally there are some disruption, however, for the most part, people get along fine."

Astoria_f341f555-3721-4bfe-8919-5163face97da,"Astoria is the place to be! It's packed with diversity and with everything near by, there's no excuse to not step out of your home. You can find all kinds of people, place and things whenever. The friendliness and conveniency is what makes this the perfect place. Also, with easy transportation and parks, traveling is more adventurous."
Astoria_0133843a-e677-45ed-a791-a8ec693e50be,"properties are often run-down, dirty, small, and over-priced

no yards or land. usually no parking."
Astoria_98599dc3-7b77-4a04-8e98-b8d493e0b443,"People are NOT friendly and keep to themselves. I often think if I were attacked on the street in broad daylight, no one would flinch or call for help. People mind their own."
Astoria_ca01adf9-83e6-435d-a12e-a222b6c5b37e,"Police are lazy. There is a severe homeless problem in the area and the police refuse to respond. They tell residents to 'blame the Mayor' (DeBlasio) and say they have bigger things to worry about. But the homeless people are setting up camps in public bank vestibules and subways terminals, which is extremely dangerous for residents.

Streets are rarely patroled, there are hoodlums and thugs out at night causing havoc and making graffiti and cops are no where in sight. Crime in the park is not uncommon. It is not a safe place to walk alone at night."
Astoria_75e05338-a198-4e66-87e5-e29f6d3f88aa,"Astoria has a wide variety of good restaurants and bars.

However it is filthy, there is garbage EVERYWHERE. It is dirty, noisy and the people are rude. There is an abundance of graffiti and potholes. I don't live here bc I Want to only bc my job brought me here. Upon graduation, I plan on relocating down south for warmer weather and a cleaner, friendlier city."
Astoria_96d1bb99-0887-48ad-9f0e-23f7076ca9af,"Overall, I know that there are far more advantages to living in this metro area than there are disadvantages. Having the convenience of being within minutes from the city is very convenient. Also, there are plenty of employment opportunities which can be obtained. The disadvantage of living in such a crowded area is the pollution, and over-crowding and delays with transportation. I would live here if I could do it all again. In the future, I see more people moving into the area and hopefully, better means of transportation."
Astoria_4407f892-1a13-4194-8e00-4c90df4af122,"The environment is very safe. There are a lot of eating and entertainment options."

Astoria_ccb00045-6a9d-42b5-8e63-a19cf5b5ca87,"Living here is great! I love my city, it is such a wonderful place to live. I have easy access to public transportation and I can easily get into Manhattan. There really is no place like NYC."
Astoria_329ccc57-4808-4ac6-9c4a-a7a4f4a31f06,"My experience with restaurants has been good. I've gotten good service and food. I'm conservative with my money and in my choice of food, so I don't go out often and don't eat things I'm unfamiliar with."
Astoria_556bff99-e48e-47ff-9ddb-6eae4dd7d040,"I've seen some places like Staples and Dunkin' Dounuts hiring recently. It seems like opportunities are out there but that people may not know about them."
Astoria_b39dd552-c9db-4592-8f8e-b75e5b04b2aa,"There will be times I go to the store and they won't have a product they told me would be restocked already. The products are dusty sometimes, which makes them unappealing."
Astoria_81d9678d-5f73-4b89-8936-ffc6446d0a0b,"The area is pretty safe. There is some crimes but that dose not impact one's life greatly. It is a bit dangerous to walk late at night especially alone because of the many bars. The police circles around the area pretty often though. At different times during the day and night."
Astoria_9c40d7e7-f765-4f78-825a-d0183f1f074a,"The public services in the area are great. I do not think that we lack anything. The proximity and reaction time of the police and fire station is very quick. They arrive at the location in less than 5 minutes."
Astoria_6191146f-fb0d-4513-8dbb-1b1a2771c283,"The employment in the area is okay. There are not as much opportunities the area is mostly made up  of small businesses.There might be a employment over time in a fast food, bar, restaurant, or grocery store. There are not as much companies in the area again mostly small bushiness. Most people work at different areas in the city."
Astoria_d46648ce-b207-4066-8f16-00d5189b66d7,"During the four seasons there are not any natural disasters. The area is really safe. During the winter there might be a few snowy days that can make it difficult for transportation. It may be really cold, but the snow is not severe. In the summer it is really hot and humid. It is only during the heat waves that it is dangerous to be out in the sun all day."
Astoria_6de94886-85b4-4dc6-83f8-c68880ce8a53,"There is a great variety of restaurants in the area. From fancy, different cultural, and fast food restaurants. The prices of the dishes is also reasonable. There are restaurants that close late so their in service for the customers. There is also plenty of bars for people to go to. There are happy hours a few days a week depending on the bar. The area is also safe if one is leaving a bar late at night."
Astoria_070f44a3-226a-4593-972f-0a95a97b8d41,"The local businesses in the area are great. The grocery stores are real close, always in stock and have variety of products and goods. There is a variety of stores from retail, pharmacies, salons, and laundry's. The stores are close and have a wide selection of products at a convenient price."
Astoria_4a7842ef-5441-44e5-b42b-2a1caacc238c,"The food choice in this area is very diverse. You can see many fast food places and chain restaurants in the area. There a few ethnic cuisine places that are good to try. You can also find organic fruit stands and markets, as well. A lot  of Halal/Kosher foods are easy to find, from restaurants to food trucks, you can find them just about anyway. Majority of New Yorkers and students both college and high school and workers on the go looking for a quick lunch go there to eat.  There are also a lot of bars and nightlife options for those wishing to wind down or have a little fun."
Astoria_d1d27739-c889-4622-8a10-4a5aa3409f5c,"There is housing but the prices are very high for it to be in a low income neighborhood. Construction companies keep building  more residences but there is not  a lot of people that can afford it. The quality of the NYCHA housing is pretty good, suitable sizes for families and mostly affordable and great view. Its worse to be too close to the water, because its the East River and sometimes when there is low tide it smells bad, but when the tide is okay, most people go fishing or canoeing/kayaking in that water. Cost of utilities is not included except for air conditioning per how many of the AC's you have. There are some vacant areas but they will sit for a while until they are turned into a new place of residence."
Astoria_06cc83ff-881e-4ddc-b254-dad36fdb310b,"It rains a lot ,and when it snows like a storm, the removal takes up to weeks. The roads may have most of the ice cleared from them, but there are big potholes and defects left there. In the summer it gets really hot and in the winter it gets really cold, the best seasons are Fall and Spring. There are rarely natural disasters around this area although we are near water, except for a couple years back when we had 2 hurricanes. Basically all you need to have around for the weather in these parts, is a jacket for warm weather, coat for colder weather, rain boots and umbrella, snow boots, gloves, hats, and scarves for the winter. You can dress more freely and lightly in the spring and summer because the weather is beautiful around that time and in the winter and fall start to bundle up with more layers because that's when it starts to get cooler."
Astoria_b56aeec3-c0d9-4cd5-98d6-18dab7a79902,"Sometimes the lights go out and it is very dark and hard to see coming home. There are frequent gun shots and the police are always around but not very helpful, they respond when they want to. Street and sidewalk maintenance is  very low, there are a lot of potholes and cracks and people can hurt themselves and wreck their vehicles. Sometimes cars run lights over here and there is no traffic control or safety for pedestrians or children crossing, except when the buses drop them off and put out the stop sign. Graffiti is somewhat accepted in this area, as many business owners allow different artists to come and show there artistic expression on the sides of buildings and walls."
Astoria_08ea4fcf-4923-45dd-aed3-65a7686ede8f,"There are many people in search of employment and very few jobs willing to give a person without job experience a chance, but how can they have experience if no one hires them. There are also new requirements needed for applying to certain jobs, its not just a high school diploma anymore. Some people are still in school looking for employment but the schedules of the work place are not suitable for them to balance school and work life. Those with a job have few to no hours per week and struggle to get promotions or better quality work they actually want."
Astoria_0b353eb7-a2e3-4638-a531-e2fbabf0034b,"The local businesses in my area include the laundromat, deli/ convenient stores, restaurants/bars, dry cleaners, gas stations, gym fitness centers, etc. The nearby laundromats has a  good schedule daily but tends to be crowded because it is the closest one. The delis/convenient stores are okay as well just has high prices on certain things. Restaurants around this area tend to get a lot of customers but sometimes has slow service but the food quality is good. Gas stations are a dime a dozen over here but the price of gas seems like it going up more than going down. Overall, if anything is needed individually, I believe everyone can get whats they need, but if they could change quality and pricing they would."

Bath Beach_7b73e280-dc2e-4739-b95f-9818d9260bd4,"What I liked most about living in this area is the fact that there is at least one Brooklyn Public Library in every borough. Additionally, the staff members there are super nice. I also liked the stores where a lot of the things they sell are on a sale. Warehouse clubs are also so promising and helpful in saving money."

Bath Beach_4c628a57-34ca-4db2-9867-4327f99f7f78,"Most people have small families and are involved in school events around the area. Because most the area have multi-family homes, there are not many buildings that have pets. Community events are scarce, if any at all, except people who attend church."
Bath Beach_8f2ed73a-5278-4623-8c51-fa2ef3d0ae7f,"Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is nice area to live in for people who want to be in New York but do not want to splurge on Manhattan prices. With the only downfall being the commuting time to the city, this area is generally a peaceful place to live. All the buildings in the area were built later in the century around the 1970's to 1980's, so they are all relatively new compared to other buildings in New York City. There are very little vacant or abandoned properties - the area is relatively cheap and with living spaces being large, most of the vacant rooms and apartments, if any, fill up quickly. The cost of living is not very high compared to other areas of Brooklyn (mainly due to its distance) with utilities being a standard rate. Most of Bensonhurst is predominately of Chinese heritage (at least within the last 10-15 years or so), so most of the local business owners and stores are targeted to Chinese people. Some of the grocery stores only have Chinese signs."
Bath Beach_87b364d9-36e3-439e-8b87-cfafa5208db1,"Most of the people in this area exercise in the outdoors. The nearest gym is about two miles out; however, a Planet Fitness just opened up recently which will probably boost more indoor activity. People are generally fit in this area due to walking to and from transportation stations and getting groceries. There is one hospital nearby, but otherwise, not too many health facilities. Personally, I exercise a few times a week, but not in my neighborhood. I work in Manhattan and frequent the gym near my workplace."
Bath Beach_1401c7a9-b55f-4cf1-a12c-b2eaab4dc392,"Bensonhurst has quite a number of local businesses, but very, very little traditional shopping locations. The neighborhood is known for its cheap restaurants and auto repair shops. Grocery stores are available, but further out of the area to where taking the bus or train would be out of the way. There are no big companies in this area as it is mainly residential. For the most part, it is not an incredibly convenient location for one-stop shop customers. Groceries and household items are things to get in this area, but for people looking to do shopping for clothes, technology, books, or anything else, they would go elsewhere."
Bath Beach_1c8247f5-3d9a-4ece-bea5-19b1db45a011,"Bensonhurst, Brooklyn is a very peaceful, residential neighborhood. There are many local shops run by ethnic families with very few franchises and chains, which gives a nice variety in shopping in the area. However, transportation is lacking with very few subway lines branching out of the area. There are MTA buses that frequent around this area of Brooklyn, but for people who do not work regular hours, there are very limited resources as most shops and transportation stop at sundown times. Because of its residential nature, the area is incredibly peaceful and good for starting families. Noise pollution is never a problem, and because of the area's peacefulness, it does not seem like the city is anywhere close. Besides the long commute to work and slowness in pace, this area is a very comfortable one to live in."
Bath Beach_369ea47b-20ca-43d4-a56a-aa594d954cb3,"It is mainly the fast food industry and/or banks . If you are in the business market, then finding a job is very easy.  You have to network and know people most of the time in order to discover job opportunities."

Battery Park City_44785e2f-955e-4a2c-aaae-2e849b8b92a8,"When we moved to Battery Park City in the 1990s, the area was a ghost town on nights and weekends.  Today, it's one of the best places in NYC, if not the US, to raise kids.  The great schools, convenient parks, water views, little league - residents have convenient access to everything that once drove them to the suburbs, especially if they have kids. But this is not a suburb, it's NYC with all the great stuff the city offers.  If you work downtown, the commute is convenient.  If you work anywhere in the city, most subway lines are a quick walk.  The Brookfield area and World Trade Center center frequently open top restaurants and stores  - then there is also the Tribeca, Seaport, Stone Street and Batter Park - all within walking distance.  The new Governors Island Park is becoming a real draw.  Public schools are nothing short of incredible.  PS 276 and PS 89 run through 8th grade.  #1 US High School, Stuyvesant, is located in BPC.  There is also an excellent select High School, Millennium High School, located in the Financial District, which gives preference to below-canal street residents. The risk and fear is the explosive growth of this neighborhood causing unknown impact.  For now, and likely some time to come, it's an absolutely awesome place to live, and so exciting."
Battery Park City_3760da77-7764-474b-a645-01ea4e71c491,"There are many dry cleaners in the area, too many really, but they are all great. The restaurants are few in numbers but are all decent. There are not enough nice cafes or bookstores. You can get most of the things you need here, though."

It's a middle class neighborhood. haven't had any problems. I don't have children so I cannot rate the schools. The residential streets are quiet. There could be better quality restaurant options. The R train is the only train in the area but there are multiple local and express buses. I've found it safe, of course use common sense and be aware of your surroundings always. I sometimes come home very late and don't feel unsafe walking home. There is a lot of shopping on 86th street. The neighborhood really has all your basic needs here. There is a great promenade to go biking, walking, jogging and really great sunset views. There are a lot of families with small children, so semi family friendly.

Bay Ridge is an area that is full of various different restaurants and places to eat, making it an area in which many younger kids, such as those who attend high schools within the area, can easily spend time with their friends. Bay Ridge goes form fast food chains, to high end restaurants, giving residents the best of both worlds.

Bayside_3f7bf5ec-dac0-4e94-9850-35bce79221d9,"Bayside is a diverse, unique town in Queens, NY. Situated right near the Little Neck Bay, this town offers a myriad of parks, restaurants, schools, a community college, and easily accessible transportation, like the Long Island Railroad, and bus services. Yet, the most unique aspect of Bayside is the people. The population has changed a bit from when I went to grade school, about 15-20 years ago, however, my neighbors remain friendly, generous and respectful. I live in between two great shopping centers, and on a major boulevard that is home to some of  NYC's best bars and restaurants. This town is for the middle class, but offers options for those looking to buy mini-mansions or smaller apartments."
Bayside_453c02ea-a39b-4690-b829-35dca9feaee8,"Bayside is a quiet place with a lot of access to different activities. You'll never be far from a fair share of restaurants, movie theaters, and bars. As far as ease of living, it is very convenient in that there are a lot of stores and services within walking distance, such as the supermarket, laundromat, and plenty of coffee shops. You definitely do not need a car to live here, which helps save money. Bayside is a residential area with a lot of houses and pretty much no apartments. The cost of living is rising, but overall it is a great place to live - especially for families."

Bayside is very close to the LIRR, and about a 20 min drive into Manhattan. Bayside is also close to Astoria, so there is always somewhere to go to enjoy your night. If you want to stay local, there is Bell Blvd, a strip of bars, restaurants, lounges, and Northern Blvd as well. What I would like to see change is the traffic. I think better traffic systems can be implemented."

Bayside_6dc1f4e1-8905-41ce-a2c2-904d246e9c2f,"Bayside is a great suburban neighborhood. There are many public schools, many of which are highly rated and produce very intelligent children. Since there are many children, it can be a bit noisy at times, especially after school hours, but it is very calm at nighttime and safe, as well. The houses here can definitely be pricy, such as in the House Beautiful Condominium Area. Commuting to Manhattan can definitely be costly, since there are no subway lines running here. There are several bus stations, as well as the Long Island Railroad service, but railroad tickets are very expensive. Overall, I would recommend living here."

I grew up being involved in basketball, baseball, and swimming in my area. These sports communities (especially Bayside little league) really enhanced by childhood and taught me what a good community looks like. My church is in Bayside, and it is my favorite place to be. I can go there and be with other Christians who live around me and also want to worship God."

Pet lovers at least on every block, and walking distance from restaurants and shopping areas."
Bayside_64e2e43f-5aeb-43a6-a7fa-8ecbff573f3b,"Slow and steady is what I would describe the public services that are done in Queens.

There is litter splattered throughout the sidewalks which the cleaning trucks do not help as much as they could. Many streets also inefficient sewage systems which cause gigantic, deep puddles of dirty water. In addition, there are  not many great things for children to do besides going to the park and beach. However, I do see many part of the community attempting to improve. For example, the Rockaway Park area is opening up new businesses that make the area more enjoyable. I definitely believe that the entire Rockaway area has a great amount of potential to enhance itselfm it is just a matter of the people in the community utilizing that potential."

The train service at times is also very bad. Sometimes I feel like the community as a whole isn't really developing that much, with the exception of the houses that are being built along the beach."

While you get to have the perks of snow and sun, there are some unfortunate natural disasters. They occur on an occasion and are extremely rare, especially compared to other states. The most common thing would be flooding but it is never severe and always manageable."

However, in the economy state we live in today, we do see struggles which serves as barricades for the American Dream. I would not blame the community for that but rather the nation itself."
Bayswater_a109edaa-b80b-4ac6-b06d-e2cfa44c0afa,"The local businesses in the area are unique, family oriented, and just own right pleasant.

Bedford Stuyvesant_5ebe6d64-83d8-49f9-bb46-d3de859bb43d,"The neighborhood I live in is very calm;not too noisy. I have a plethora of surrounding stores and shops which include groceries, restaurants, and clothing. There are a few gyms available as well. The neighborhood's cleanliness is up to par. As the weeks pass by, the gentrification rate seems to be skyrocketing, along with a variety of commercial and residential developments."
Bedford Stuyvesant_9eed36d9-97a1-4bc8-be77-7d88c6995632,"I love my neighborhood that is edgy and now, diverse. The area consists of many professionals, families and artists. There are a lot of businesses and restaurants, with new ones that pop up all the time. The only down side is that with every new person that moves in the rent also rises."

I would like to be able to walk from the train without worrying about flying bullets. There are two public housing buildings near me, and I support that. I grew up very poor myself. However, I know there is a lot of drug trafficking going on so I need to take the long route home anytime after 7pm. I love the bogedas on either side of my block and I love how friendly the tenants in my building are. It is also very close to safer neighborhoods like Clinton Hill and Fort Greene (which is where I go to school)."

Although these all make for a great up and coming neighborhood,  changes need to made. There is, without a doubt, a serious drug and gun violence problem that needs to be tackled. Increasingly, the streets are becoming dangerous and the picture painted for the countless kids is sadly, a deplorable one."

Bedford Stuyvesant_7d7e2ee6-680e-43a8-8f08-b061769c890c,"The crime rate in my neighborhood has decreased considerably in the past several years, but crime still exists. I like to think it is just a little more inconspicuous. The police in my neighborhood are adamant about responding to small criminal activity like shoplifting, traffic misconduct and mild violence. Yet, when issues of domestic abuse, robbery or drive-by shootings (occasionally) occur, there is a very slow police response."

Bedford Stuyvesant_795351f0-e507-4b1f-93d4-6f268e8b8b91,"Most of this neighborhood is consumed with Public Housing. The prices are cheap. The housing situations are bad. In my apartments we frequently have to call construction workers because the walls fall apart. They crumble into white dust. We lose hot water sometimes. One of our bathrooms has been broken for as long as I can remember. Every time we flush the toilet, the water leaks into our downstairs neighbors apartment, so we stopped using it all together. The Maintenance people come sometimes, but they never completely fix a situation. They knock down the walls, then come back months later to patch it up. Or they'd stop our water from flowing out of the sink, and they won't put it back on until a week later. This is overall not a good are to reside in."
Bedford Stuyvesant_1a65eb71-37f7-46cf-b8be-5c04773ca8ed,"Most people live here their whole lives. Each generation says here, because its affordable to live. Very few make it out. Many people have pit bulls and big dogs. Though an apartment setting isn't too ideal for that kind of dog. There are community events, but many people don't participate in it."
Bedford Stuyvesant_b2939c05-7d87-4ccd-bf0f-473e58943c1d,"Crime rates are high. The average person wouldn't feel very safe in this neighborhood. A persons only protection is themselves."

I would much rather live in a neighborhood like Fort Green or Park Slope. Compared to other locations, Bedford Stuyvesant could do much better. It's still in the same condition as its always been. Crime rates are still high. Police response rates are still low. Education is still mediocre. Lots of improvements could be made."

I have enjoyed the rich culture of my neighbors who were about the community.  We had block parties in the summer time, basketball tournaments and bus rides to amusement parks.  I would live here all over again and hope my kids would experience the sense of community like i have.   But the neighborhood is changing and the folks that are moving in don't care about the generations that started this neighborhood.  They are driving up the cost of the housing and forcing the elderly home owners to move out because they can't afford the taxes anymore. This is not making my neighborhood better for my black neighbors."

If I had a choice, I would probably have moved on another street as mine has a severe loitering problem. Other than that, the neighborhood has started to become more diversed and new small businesses are popping up here and there. Although diversity is a welcome change, I hope it does not enter gentrification territory. All in all, Bed-Stuy is amazing!"

Bedford Stuyvesant_b47cae00-2300-47d3-ab9b-fccd2652ab2b,"Winters are extremely cold, summers are hot, spring and fall are average. But it's recently been like this for the past couple of years. Only when the weather is extremely bad, such as blizzards or constant snow storms then things are slow. This area does't experience natural disasters other than an earthquake one summer and a mini tornado another. The most essential items in my wardrobe area are winter coats, winter boots, umbrellas, hats, and scarves."
Bedford Stuyvesant_52008b10-b799-4953-8248-b7b9f28e84f6,"If you like local food and drink and not a large crowd then there are maybe a few options that you can go to. But if you like a large crowd or more options then you would have to go downtown Brooklyn or the city (Manhattan)."
Bedford Stuyvesant_1adb5403-c6e7-457a-8200-471792e0e590,"I'm not keen on what most people do for a living in my area. I do know that there are a lot of small businesses that aren't owned by big companies in my area, except for maybe KFC. In my area there is a job center, laundromats, dry cleaners, spanish restaurants, pizza shops, dominican salons, corner stores, etc. those kinds of jobs."
Bedford Stuyvesant_b4318bba-1000-4dbd-8b8c-7e02f36619e1,"There are a variety of options in this neighborhood. You have convenience stores on every corner, salons in walking distance, and restaurants and bars. The only thing that use some improvement is the food options - we have Chinese stores, pizza shops and KFC's but we also have a neat little restaurant although it's pretty expensive."

Bedford Stuyvesant_614ae932-4011-44e6-aa18-d2a99dd3beaa,"The houses are nice. Houses are constantly being renovated. Cost of housing is on the rise ($1000+ for a 1 bedroom). There is an abandoned lot about a block away. My block is convenient as it is close to transportation."
Bedford Stuyvesant_69fa154e-5d75-47c0-8a81-1763d6c7aa08,"Police respond very fast and in numbers when they perceive Non-Whites to be a problem. Also, if you are white or perceived to be, they are more likely to respond quickly. Police are usually present by the train stations and crimes don't happen that often."

Bedford Stuyvesant_6b6aafe3-4e57-4715-992d-8faf56e44fec,"Late night options are not the best (Popeye's, Crown Fried Chicken, corner store), but who's looking to eat a salad after coming out of a club? There is a variety of restaurants depending on how far you walk within the 5 block radius. There is some African food, Caribbean food, fast food, American restaurants and lounges. This area is becoming more gentrified by the year but I truly believe the stores that have been around for at least 5 years are the places to be. Some newly opened restaurants have normal priced happy hours ie. $5 wine special $3-$4 beer special and others are cheaper ie. $2 house drinks. I personally love to eat chicken roti from Ally's. If you want yourself some Trinbagonian (Trinidadian and Tobagonian) food, that is the best place to go!"
Bedford Stuyvesant_a69d28ff-25ff-46d9-9228-9028b154554e,"Most people do not work in the area. The job outlook is higher for White people due to gentrification. Top employers are retail and fast food chains. Neighbors do not socialize that much to talk about what each family member does for a living."
Bedford Stuyvesant_bbd84d7c-ec49-46ca-b453-efafc5b3050a,"It all depends on where you go. There is a particular Black owned laundromat that I LOVE. The other laundromats are Asian owned and the people are not as respectful. There is Caribbean, African, Chinese and fast food within a 5 block radius. I can definitely get most of what I need unless I need to go to the DMV or get something ID related. There is even a goodwill which I enjoy because it allows me to donate my clothes when I have cleaned my room."

Bedford Stuyvesant_b42a39c1-1365-41d0-a38f-c681acb65c28,"Still lots of mom and pop stores around. You can get almost everything without leaving the area or venturing too far outside of it. Grocery stores still leave much to be desired and many folks opt for delivery."
Bedford Stuyvesant_e07363ea-0067-4bc3-a6e7-a55efe62e7e7,"It's NYC so there's crime. There are still some shootings and other violent crimes in this area but they aren't very random and tend to occur among people engaged in criminal activity together or those close to them. That doesn't make it ok, but it's not as though crime is rampant and indiscriminate."

Bedford Stuyvesant_de84ffb3-d0c7-4b09-99eb-af8634ca0a4b,"We're quite inland, so you don't really have to worry about all the water damage from storms or flooding. Our only problem with bad thunderstorms is that it rains a lot."
Bedford Stuyvesant_5a659105-6e88-465e-98ef-97659f5eda56,"There's a track a few blocks away at Boys and Girls High School, but aside from that you'll be on your own with exercise. As long as you aren't the kind of person who needs a gym, you'll be fine."
Bedford Stuyvesant_01c76324-b70f-4add-9420-908499e2a017,"You have what you need, the train station isn't wheelchair accessible, but the bus line follows the train exactly. You only have to take it two stops to reach a wheelchair accessible station too."
Bedford Stuyvesant_6ab132d4-e0b4-4a70-85d7-025f6fb96c34,"It has everything you need in a residential community so that things stay at a good noise level. It's not a commercial area, which is why we don't have everything."
Bedford Stuyvesant_c9579cf4-5a57-4886-bc4b-d62aac95ebb5,"There are no dog parks, but there aren't any rules against bringing your dog (or they're never enforced). The large park by Breevort offers a lot of variety, but most residents prefer the park near P.S. 40, which has courts and a small children's park."
Bedford Stuyvesant_6071ce0c-9eb3-40d9-9057-9a9382b9f93b,"The people like to stay in their homes for a while, but recently a lot of previously abandoned buildings or buildings that have been vacant for a long time are being fixed up and rented out. Parking is great unless it's Sunday, in which case you'll have to try your luck or hope you can double park."
Bedford Stuyvesant_f03df3c9-6602-40f5-bd68-4c35298d392b,"Again, the neighborhood's residents are mostly from the Caribben (including Guyana), and a lot of women work as home health aids. They're really great people and a lot of the neighbors are like family. Personally, my block was divided economically, with families that had more money living in the apartments across the street. However, money usually doesn't matter since most people shop in the same places."
Bedford Stuyvesant_f10d5ab5-a8ac-48e4-85bb-5104aaf6885d,"Personally, all of the neighbors and store owners are very friendly, and the corner fast food place is cheap and delicious. It's a very Caribbean neighborhood and you'll usually have a friend within walking distance. (It's about 20 minutes to Bushwick at most). There's also an Indian place if you don't mind a walk down Howard Avenue. The train is extremely reliable and pleasant (C) and so is the bus (B25). The B47 can give you some trouble with timing if you're in a rush. If given the opportunity, I would definitely live in this area again (even the same apartment if I could!)"
Bedford Stuyvesant_fd3f1ee7-e00e-461b-96fd-4b070d6163db,"Crime has gone down over the past years. I feel safe. There are many precincts scattered throughout the borough."
Bedford Stuyvesant_1431eaa8-ee2a-44c4-8f54-2d7d40c6cbd4,"There is an even distribution between mom-and-pop stores and big companies. Smaller companies are able to thrive."
Bedford Stuyvesant_e4d65073-f62e-4c84-8a9b-7ed6e0d2a799,"Quality of housing okay depending on the family. There aren't many vacant or abandoned properties in the area; heavily residential area. The cost of housing and util ties is very expensive."
Bedford Stuyvesant_02c96e25-94bf-4611-85a6-7fb8dd4cd1df,"General atmosphere is pretty relaxing, safe and fast-paced. I'd probably not live in this particular neighborhood if given the chance. However, I wouldn't mind being close-by in nearby neighborhoods. Compared to everywhere else in the country, while the rent is probably one of the most expensive, the quality of living of some of the residents sucks."
Bedford Stuyvesant_fcce461c-1d94-445a-825f-255ca3e57b5f,"There are a few workout facilities such as Planet Fitness and Blink Fitness. Peoples are not as physically active as they should be. Hospital facilities are within walking distance but the quality can be better. I stay physically active through yoga."
Bedford Stuyvesant_5fc8139b-8dca-45ee-950e-3fdfb6c3f37b,"The weather does not have any drastic changes on my lifetstyle living here."

Bedford Stuyvesant_de9cba45-f2b6-4af0-96da-32d0fd5febb1,"People who lived here when I first moved in is presently still here. The community is pretty together."
Bedford Stuyvesant_5e2fdf80-2031-4a51-a751-10fffb4bb99b,"The attractions in this neighborhood are bad. In my opinion there is nothing that will attract tourists here."
Bedford Stuyvesant_91f494f5-0391-45d1-bd35-97c3dd8df38b,"The general atmosphere is not the worst, but it is okay. The neighborhood has changed drastically from when I first moved here so I am seeing major great changes for it."
Bedford Stuyvesant_624c5f1a-57a4-4562-9192-4e55c15ddc35,"This neighborhood is beginning to become very diverse and the people are okay."
Bedford Stuyvesant_e7f3097d-c211-4632-881c-56f872f60b1e,"There are a wide range of brown stone houses in this area. The quality of living seems pretty doable. The once abandoned properties that was in this neighborhood has now been created into houses."
Bedford Stuyvesant_34712c2c-733d-45f4-9898-ddced305729a,"I feel safe walking the streets at late hours because I have not been a witness to visible crime. The police presence are extremely high in my neighborhood as far as foot patrolling. The only concern that I have is the graffiti and vandalism of certain businesses in the area."
Bedford Stuyvesant_0ef0f1fe-d22d-4fc2-8574-28d97ac054d1,"Everything in my area is very accessible when it comes to grocery stores, laundromats, cleaners and everything else of importance for an everyday lifestyle."
Bedford Stuyvesant_d815585a-f543-4007-afd3-6c59ee317bf2,"The nature of this neighborhood can be described as filthy in certain places due to lack of recycling, excessive littering and waste in prohibited areas."
Bedford Stuyvesant_9d59703b-e01c-4fd2-b9fc-fa0a24b72b02,"I'm a physical active individual because I prefer to walk instead pf taking public transportation considering the fact that most stores are in close proximity. The convenience of the hospital facilities are close by."
Bedford Stuyvesant_2c67f5c4-180d-4d3a-a266-2906febb4796,"In my opinion the buses that run in my neighborhood are pretty accessible and there are always available parking spaces."
Bedford Stuyvesant_ab651c52-f063-4ff3-9e4c-cd4eca269781,"the public services in my neighborhood should be better than what it currently is."
Bedford Stuyvesant_ca7ee3f5-53ae-493e-98e1-fbf9d85f4049,"The weather has become more extreme in recent years. We were not directly impacted by Sandy or the other tropical storms, but many in this neighborhood were."
Bedford Stuyvesant_7a101167-cd6e-478c-95f2-5228fa249ae7,"This is an inner city area so housing is very tight and people live on top of one another. There are a lot of beautiful brownstone buildings but many need renovation. There are some blocks with a lot of civic pride, but others with none, it seems."
Bedford Stuyvesant_37742b71-940a-4c02-8f58-202512119a83,"Public transportation is generally pretty good. There are bike lanes but drivers often do not respect them and there are a lot of accidents."
Bedford Stuyvesant_60d0c7b0-c432-4fff-9297-5fe5c27785ee,"There are a few very nice restaurants but overwhelming the food options are poor. There are a lot of bars, though, and popular spots for young people which are always very busy."
Bedford Stuyvesant_a933cf6a-5119-48ce-8aa3-432fe80668e6,"This is a very diverse neighborhood and most people are friendly, although not all. There is still a sense of distrust among some of the sub-groups by others."
Bedford Stuyvesant_8a7e3f7f-c2e9-41f0-9f08-3d2f1314e618,"Most people keep their pets indoors so it is hard to know the answers here."
Bedford Stuyvesant_2d90e9e8-2cf4-4d97-b08b-98f91c03b6f6,"There are certainly worse neighborhoods, but there are also far more better ones than this."
Bedford Stuyvesant_cebb2e2e-7b45-4e94-9d29-2d044923dbfb,"Rents are increasing dramatically and the neighborhood is changing rapidly. In some ways this is good, in some it is not. Life is hard for most people living locally."
Bedford Stuyvesant_f8138c8f-8abf-4811-a980-7c76a9078dc9,"More bars and restaurants are opening up on a regular basis but other services are limited and grocery stores are few and far between, particularly ones with healthy food."
Bedford Stuyvesant_422273a9-be59-4969-ba50-e7064e1e63ed,"There are not enough athletic events for young people so then end up with too much free time and often get into trouble."
Bedford Stuyvesant_e0d17346-a5a2-4851-bd9c-8fc213485354,"There are no great venues in this neighborhood so aside from the occasional outdoor concert, locals need to travel to neighboring areas for events."
Bedford Stuyvesant_b12436cb-d723-452e-b47b-f109cbd655a8,"There is still a lot of crime, locally."
Bedford Stuyvesant_2fb40cd6-54ba-4554-911b-3ba283b048d6,"This is an urban area with very little green outdoor space."
Bedford Stuyvesant_d7ee8a5f-6a68-46a4-9676-3c0736f82877,"I have never had a bad experience with a natural disaster because the buildings are strong and can bear most weather conditions. Natural disasters are very rare in this area. Sometimes, the snow is not cleared the way it should be and people in wheelchairs, such as my sister, have a harder time because of it."
Bedford Stuyvesant_c031b928-2f57-4300-a825-b86a092fd589,"People that live in my building will greet you, but generally in the neighborhood, everyone goes about their business and doesn't take a moment to say hello. It has become more diverse in recent years."
Bedford Stuyvesant_723f9f3a-064d-491b-a0a6-b93e45535238,"There aren't really preferable jobs here, but there are jobs. They usually pay the bare minimum and the most available ones are at fast food chains it seems."
Bedford Stuyvesant_1e7a9cce-c36c-42e5-bb06-2de2682b6aae,"Over here, there are mostly Chinese restaurants and fast food, which I don't prefer at all. They are cheaper, but the quality of the food is no good, so price isn't really a factor here. I would prefer healthier food, even if it were a bit more pricey."
Bedford Stuyvesant_2a1e753b-bbe1-4888-880d-1ff69006e7f5,"I see this area improving very much. There are new businesses and the area seems much cleaner than before. Also, the crime rate has gone down in these past few years, so it is always a plus to feel more secure in the place you reside. I would not live here if given the opportunity again because of the lack of community spirit and most people, like myself, prefer to stay to themselves. Hopefully, this area can get at least one fitness center/gym, a recreational center, a public track, and cleaner public housing buildings."
Bedford Stuyvesant_ed9fa74d-6282-490e-9259-ff45fa72bde5,"There are typically police officers around, so that helps a great deal in terms of reaction time. Everything else is fairly moderate. I have yet to register to vote, but I feel education needs much improvement and the schools in the area need better resources."
Bedford Stuyvesant_6612e592-d59c-49a5-965e-d485543b0df5,"It is moderately safe for pedestrians, but it is always good to be cautious. Some drivers run red lights or speed unnecessarily, so being careful is a must. Traffic varies, but is usually pretty congested. Parking is difficult to do over here because Fulton Street can be an extremely busy."
Bedford Stuyvesant_022f5680-c09c-428a-8b91-3738206c3bf8,"The most working out I have seen are the playing of basketball and from time to time a person running. There isn't really a place to work out around here, so I assume that some people that are serious about fitness work out in another neighborhood. The hospitals in the neighborhood seem to be diminishing and a few have been closed or have limited resources. If I had to go to the hospital for any reason, I would go to one outside my community. I stay physically active by working out in my home."
Bedford Stuyvesant_19e7a349-b40d-4833-8ab7-23e07285a202,"The neighborhood is diverse in what types of stores are here, but the quality is sometimes poor or unnecessarily expensive. There are not too many retail stores or gyms around. I usually shop outside of my neighborhood and workout at home."
Bedford Stuyvesant_535c6f5b-aedd-4523-86c2-8d359cd96e38,"Years ago, there would be a number of shootings in this area, but that has decreased a significant amount. The police presence has increased greatly. I know of no neighborhood watch and I don't utilize common areas of the building, I am very much to myself and am cautious at all times."
Bedford Stuyvesant_87e7264d-359c-4634-b5cf-b785ce27eb41,"I don't do much in this neighborhood because I have never felt comfortable here despite living here most of my life. The neighborhood gives me a gloomy feeling, so I typically do everything outside of my community. I am not informed of what goes on here in terms of celebratory events and such, but I do try to keep up with the local news at least."
Bedford Stuyvesant_8c187530-8a13-48a9-86b4-e0cb647abe3e,"There is much public housing in my neighborhood and unfortunately, many of these edifices are not looked after and are unsanitary. They have been building new apartment buildings everywhere I turn, and they seem to be much nicer than those that currently exist, so that is definitely a good thing. Not sure about the cost of those places, but I'm certain they're more expensive, which I suppose is understandable."
Bedford Stuyvesant_daf8dcfb-3dcd-48bb-b9df-159f03ee0e52,"The parks are of average quality. Some don't have much to offer. There is, however, a new park in my neighborhood that is much cleaner and has much to offer for young children up until teenagers and young adults. More parks of this manner would be appreciated. There isn't a track in the neighborhood either, besides one that is limited to outsiders at a high school."
Bedford Stuyvesant_996b8f7f-78e2-483e-927d-493b6674446b,"I don't frequent nightclubs so I can't offer much advice on that but there are a range of restaurants. Other forms of entertainment are not too apparent (theatre, etc)"

Bedford Stuyvesant_634f697e-4d0e-4f11-9aea-b8a2f95b7ff1,"the neighborhood is the typical 'ghetto,' yet there is a sense of community amongst the families who have lived there for a while. the neighborhood is amidst a crucial point of gentrification, so there a quite a lot of changes going on; both good and bad. for one, because of the influx of a new demographic, there are more well kept restaurants and shops, yet there are also more commercial buildings and high rises popping up, completely eliminating the 19th century decor of the brownstone laden neighborhood thats lived within itself for decades"
Bedford Stuyvesant_33085364-84cf-4599-97fc-3ce8ca3ef0cb,"It is very quiet in the winter, with that being said in the summer it can be a bit loud, only because of all the block parties and cookouts."

It is not that far from Manhattan and right on the border of Long Island. It is right near Belmont Racetrack so when the Belmont Stakes is on in June you can go there with no problem.  There are nice restaurants in the area.  There are good schools in the area to send your kids."

The school district is one of the best in New York City, and there are many options available for the students and parents to choose from.

The rent though can be lower since in this building i live in now with my mother, we have to pay a separate electric bill. Which makes funding for other things a little hard. There's great store around here though, such as bakeries, pizza shops, frozen yogurt, etc. Plus the St. Barnabas hospital is right down the street from my building I currently live in.

Living in the city that never sleep has every day challenge me to take advantage of every second I am awake. Here you can see how people from everywhere do their best to achieve their dreams and goals. Having that example in front of me motivates me to not stop working. Coming from an island,Puerto Rico, where thing were more slow down I can feel the rush of newyorkers and their need to achieve great changes in the world.

Bensonhurst_b6b40e1b-56af-4aeb-946a-ca102791a563,"Bensonhurst is a highly diverse and multicultural area in the south west of Brooklyn, representing one of the Neighborhoods that commuters, lower class families or students choose to move in to. Despite of local high schools, Brooklyn College is the closest collegial institution and easily reachable with the B82 bus line. That bus line therefore connects to the train (D,F, N) and makes colleges in Brooklyn like ASA College, LIU, St. Francis, etc. reachable. 
Since the rent prices are more affordable compared to the city, some grocery stores and chinese health food stores also have low prices, but it is still New York City and fact of the matter is: most of the local stores are pricy and not preferably healthy. 86th Street therefore illustrates the main shopping area in this region with a diversity of job opportunity. From warehouseman over bank clerk to salesman, job opportunities are given, even though it might be hard to get a position."
Bensonhurst_211ef62e-b4bf-4690-bca0-7ad4d3cba81a,"Bensonhurst a lovely community that is diverse and friendly. The area is peaceful and quiet, there are stores that are very convenient and there are many options of buses within walking distance. The only thing I would change it more street light in certain areas, sometime its a bit to dark walking home late at night."
Bensonhurst_2228b444-e9db-47cf-b759-53ad4ccd6681,"This area is a great place to live and to grow up in from a young age. As a primarily Italian and Asian neighborhood many of its residents are middle working class people who value family and safety. Overall it is a fame neighborhood with a very low crime rate, and I can personally attest that I have never experienced any wrongdoing. I have lived here for the past 10 years and would recommend this neighborhood to young families or anyone looking to live in a quiet, peaceful part of Brooklyn."
Bensonhurst_d08a738f-1f8e-4125-8f31-749475b39958,"Everything is in waling distance. Various coffee shops, grocery stores and restaurants around to choose from. Couple of family friendly parks around as well."
Bensonhurst_5a92f65c-9431-4398-b901-240b2abf3f93,"The thing I love most about this neighborhood is the diversity that can be found here. Although the demographics of the community is quickly shifting so that more Asian families are settling here, there are still traces of the older Italian, Russian, and Jewish communities. There are many stores and restaurants that have been established here and are remembered by the people here as well as newer restaurants that are opening."
Bensonhurst_fa1a0eed-6eb5-46ad-9fd1-3ef3992f0d3d,"Bensonhurst is a pretty secure place and fantastic to raise a family since everything you could need whether that be food, clothes, or school supplies are all just a walk down the block away. The schools in the area however could improve with the help of more dedicated teachers, and for high school, many kids have to go out of the area if they want to attend a high performing school. "
Bensonhurst_af2f0f68-af9b-4ea0-b45e-fbdd69fe58af,"There are plenty of restaurants all around with low prices and different kind of services available too."
Bensonhurst_e2b98f9b-be67-4348-afe0-e6d7f7b3b23a,"If you're not from here you will never know the DRAMATIC change in demographic. A once heavily Italian populated area is now mostly Asian. Those who remain here almost all know each other. Always slight traffic, heavy during rush hours. Similar business on every block; nail salons, 99 cent stores, deli/groceries and tons of sushi and Chinese restaurants. If you're looking for work; you may have to go beyond the neighborhood if you don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese. Buses are on every major avenue but it helps to get their schedules memorized. Different age groups in large bunches. Plenty of schools. Parking is ridiculous if you get home after 6:30. Relatively quiet. In a way, slightly traditional Brooklyn living. It's the closest you'll get to living like it was in the 80's as a few of the old school stores are still around. Best. Pizza. Hands. Down."
Bensonhurst_23bd70bb-5dac-42d0-9c00-d4d17017fd29,"Bensonhurst is a nice and safe neighborhood, with good commute service (bus lines B8, B4, B9, train lines D and N close by). There's also many diverse food places with relatively good prices, and great cafes to chill in."
Bensonhurst_5265a993-4d2b-405c-8646-e54e2e7c47df,"Not as bad as you would expect."
Bensonhurst_fd4ac665-e7e6-491b-afbf-b1af6c169c5f,"It's not as bad as the media or public opinion portrays it. There is a rich culture known as the 'New York state of mind' and it is one that cannot be explained. I encouraged all to experience it for yourself."
Bensonhurst_2c8bdfd7-163b-4a2d-886d-e55b8da88348,"Overall, safety is great. There are little to no crimes happening, and police don't really have a reason to be in this neighborhood because of that. However, you never know when something might happen because we do live in New York City."
Bensonhurst_b6931564-6ef8-4a6d-bef6-b64f78f9018d,"It's a relatively safe neighborhood to live in. There's a plethora of food options available. The MTA is accessible, too. I wouldn't mind living here again."

The structures of the houses seem to differ in their own kind of way and I also like the fact that each houses are not in compact so there's enough room in between them. The cost of housing and utilities differ in each neighborhood, but are affordable. The worst areas to reside or live is the north side because there is always little to moderate gang activity surrounding the areas, in every corner. Hence, there are also the best areas to stay which is everywhere except the north side. A noticeable amount of vacant or abandoned properties is present, but they usually are filled in no time."

Brownsville_4bf0bb3f-bda5-4e58-ae90-d132d48b1644,"Local businesses tend to hold items that you need or you can go there for last minute items, but more often than not I go out of the neighborhood for supplies."

Brownsville_82b4efca-13fa-4114-8657-3ac44c966a78,"The atmosphere isn't as tense as it might be in other places in the country like Chicago for example but, it's also not as nice as an area in the same borough such as Williamsburg or Park Slope. I don't hate living here and, I've definitely lived in worse places so I would probably live here again if I had to do it all over again. And as for the future of Brownsville, I believe it has potential but only if the rate of high school and college graduates can some how increase."
Brownsville_98647d4b-a0f3-41a6-ab08-0a2d4d3f70f9,"In an area with a high minority concentration, such as this, there is noticeable crime and at times I do not always feel comfortable in my neighborhood. However to combat the majority of crimes that take place, there is at least one police officer on every block and stores close relatively early. This has been extremely effective in lowering the crime in my area but, it is still more prevalent than I would like."
Brownsville_8bec7b09-8621-419d-9ab9-8a0a5368403f,"There is no space, its dangerous (especially in Brownsville), on another note, the INSIDE of the apartments are actually pretty good with nice layouts."
Brownsville_e6ea9122-26c4-42bc-a14e-cb8fd54247cd,"I have switched to organic meat, I don't eat pork or many sweets, and this area is typical for food high in calories, sodium, and fat. I have to travel far to get fresh fruits/vegetables and organic meat."

Brownsville_0001afa8-67e7-4f1a-b108-49eec2da2029,"There is not a great amount of companies in the area that offer good paying, career based jobs. Most of the places around are Pharmacies, Fast Food and Deli Stores. All of the fast food restaurants are minimum wage, and I know with my particular set of skills I deserve more. Unfortunately, specific stores have budgets they have to follow. The Pharmacies and Deli Stores in the area are mostly family owned and operated."

Bull s Head_82002756-cd39-4015-83b0-b43d620c80bf,"Definitely love the neighborhood. Many families live in the area and many kids play outside altogether. If a new family moves in, the neighborhood will slowly get to know them and welcome them."
Bull s Head_4c995c1f-bd37-49c8-83ab-7989726a7a29,"The cost of living in general is becoming unrealistic so this area is probably no different from others that are similar to it in this matter. There are few abandoned properties and the quality of houses are pretty sturdy but updates can be done."
Bull s Head_6d2daef0-72da-4fff-9dbb-439248392e56,"The sense of community in this area is simply okay. If you are lucky enough to find neighbors who you can become very close with like in my case it makes your sense of community stronger. Most people who live in my area have resided here for several years with few new neighbors in the past ten years. Many people have pets including myself most people are animal lovers."
Bull s Head_0f1ded65-e445-45b9-8576-d3edf7a95d44,"I have noticed as I am getting older that there is more crime in my area, mostly dealing with drug usage. The police are not often present but my concerns for safety go above the topic of the area and into more political and societal concerns we face as citizens."
Bull s Head_0e3eebf3-ad53-4efd-bea1-e3b06484b0ed,"My neighborhood is not terrible. Most of the people are friendly and I am close to stores that carry necessities if I needed something at a moments notice. The area is getting a lot more crowded with several town house complexes being built around the area which I am sure will be more and more prominent in the years to come."

Staten Island is growing not only with businesses but with more people moving in.  My father has lived here in the same house for over 40 years.  It is a great place to raise a family."
Bull s Head_3fbe1106-a430-4af0-9abe-47813450b19d,"I don't mind living in this area I know the people in the community. My oldest son is in a good private school and I hope that my other two boys will be able to go there as well. I need the money to help pay for the school and I hope that I get help to continue their education. The public schools are horrible and I feel they need to be in a better environment academically and athletically"
Bushwick_a06f625e-a147-4ebd-9f9e-f547a53d276f,"Bushwick is a great place for young people- if your in your 20's. There is a very grungy scene because it where people move to live in New York for cheap. Its becoming very gentrified, but still has a lot of diversity. There are a tons of bars and it has a really good art scene. It is hard to buy healthy food, especially if you move here because you are poor. As mentioned, this area is becoming extremely gentrified so its cheap but the rent prices are skyrocketing."
Bushwick_f5920cd4-b6ef-482c-b476-f02ebe5ac42f,"Bushwick is an incredible place to follow the dreams of young immigrant adults with creative minds! It is blooming and creating new business opportunity. Residents of Bushwick are heavily involved with their local community. However, I wish it would be cleaner."

Good for families as for young international people. Lively bars and restaurants. Great place for music"
Bushwick_b59fb7b0-03ec-4ab5-b7fc-e265e8be80cf,"I love the bushwick scenery and friendly faces all around, stores and upbeat community. I would like to see the community help with the litter and waste thats thrown."
Bushwick_1b6de49d-1e75-42b2-bc4e-399c247516fa,"I'm a resident whose been born and raised in Bushwick. I like that it is very diverse. I also like that it is a very commutable neighborhood as well. For instance, near where I live I have access to a Brooklyn Public Library, Catholic Church, public schools (elementary, intermediate, and high school), various fast food restaurants (Taco Bell, IHOP, little Ceasar's, Burger King, McDonald's, etc.), various delis, 99cent stores, party stores, a hospital (Woodhull), and M and J trains for commute to other places."
Bushwick_ccb57e4a-47a1-4a65-b700-70763945e1a6,"Bushwick is a NYC neighborhood approximately 80,000 inhabitants. It has very quickly become the 'hip' neighborhood in the past couple of years. Kindness and compassion can take you far, especially in Bushwick where truly diverse crowds with different expectations and interests live side by side. Bushwick is historically one of the most dangerous parts of NYC but should be fine if you’re aware of surroundings, especially at night. Bushwick has been getting increasing amounts of press in the past couple of years. The truth is that this neighborhood is really amazing. It is really easy to connect with people in this neighborhood. You will likely meet people who will totally inspire and energize you."
Bushwick_fca1c9e8-64e8-42db-9516-58070c07023e,"It's not a lot of crime. The police are visible most of time. I feel safe and comfortable usually."
Bushwick_bed82652-6a65-42d0-a809-1abcbcdce82e,"I think I might have a bias because this is where I grew up but I love Brooklyn &I love Bushwick. There atmosphere of the area has changed for the better. It;s a lot more friendlier and welcoming. The only thing I don't like is the gentrification, obviously,"
Bushwick_ca926ecf-f813-4a2a-939b-5a4d2883fb73,"The police isn't around much and they get to you late, as usual. On the bright side, crime is low. There might be a few robberies but overall its low."
Bushwick_42493b34-7c6a-4612-a1af-a2b50e15b9d9,"I would love to grow up in my neighborhood again but as I get older I'd like to move out to another neighborhood. Now, there are not longer mixtures of races around but mainly caucasians. I see this area becoming more of a business area rather than a neighborhood to call home. Every where there are cafes and less Bodegas like before when hispanics were the majority. It's really nice area with art all around, I'd give it a 6.9/10"
Bushwick_734ffbe6-e72a-419d-a2bc-df6ec178a1d5,"It could be way better. A lot of crime used to happen. One of my complaints would be the partying at various hours of the night. Theres a lot of smoking weed and recently i have found heroin needles."

Bushwick_86d67975-5dec-477f-896b-a14882408f4a,"I believe crime has probably gone up over the years, and safety is something that has lessened. There was a time when I felt safe with having a cop around me, it was the coolest thing ever. But now, it is not the same feeling anymore."
Bushwick_86950e22-4fc0-45a2-b4b6-6fe3eb5bea64,"I have been living here for almost 10 years, and I personally never had issues with it. But around me, the area is sometimes not the safest, and there are things that you wish would truly change."

Bushwick_754af261-91fa-4282-ba87-04d638aa033f,"I work in downtown Brooklyn, I do not believe the employment scene in this neighborhood is thriving since many of the  business are small business, family owned and are often not open to hiring people who are outside of their cultures."

Bushwick_b30c1d24-6098-40f3-88c7-51cf376f5fd4,"Its Bushwick. The gentrification is 'exploding'. The hipsters are 'taking over'. The usual."

Bushwick_b12abb24-7253-4362-93bc-9743f1ce2f97,"it is not the best place to make encounters or go sight-seeing but is a decent place to live if you are a student in college or a young professional."
Bushwick_5dade891-5075-4cd2-a675-c20f033f0739,"Nothing to complain about. The snow is plowed the morning after but there are a few potholes in the streets."

Bushwick_de74a69a-1974-46d7-ae37-6f48aff518e3,"It never was a quiet place but neither was i a quiet person. i felt safe living here. Almost everyone got along. If the place stayed like i remembered it than yes i would return to live there"
Bushwick_3c9495fa-291d-4700-9634-cc08a3156afe,"There was about 4 parks nearby. Trees were planted infront of almost every house/apartment. There was a lot of littering though."
Bushwick_1a4f4296-4629-48aa-8c7c-d9000fbe81e2,"I never feel in danger in my neighborhood. It has a bad reputation, but I feel safe here. People judge Bushwick because it's home to a large Hispanic population, which in many people's minds equates danger. If they opened their eyes, they would see it's a vibrant neighborhood where many people have lived their entire lives."
Bushwick_51945af1-0bce-4876-9da2-c2ad54e1815b,"The businesses here are mixed; some are new and trendy, and others have been here for decades. The area is heavily gentrified and caters to the new groups moving in, which explains the abundance of hip restaurants and clothing stores. The older restaurants are usually owned by Hispanic families and are delicious."
Bushwick_4c540a72-2d39-4962-8914-e7c43c0c4af4,"Most residents in my area work low-wage service jobs. They don't pay enough to support a family, but are the way most people survive."
Cambria Heights_eb974d5d-5950-4731-a753-a3f5bac4b8a3,"I have lived here my entire life. The neighborhood is clean, there are thriving businesses, and it's safe. We are served by the 105th precinct. There are number of good schools in District 29. We have diverse food options & access to various transportation. JFK is 15 minutes from my house. My friends say I live on a Leave it to Beaver block. I don't think I would change a thing."
Cambria Heights_c4b31959-947e-4574-9626-cca70e4c4699,"I spent 20 years here and it was a very pleasant place to live. My only issues are the public schools which were not challenging for my children and the public transportation was scarce."
Cambria Heights_c879574a-878e-4b1e-992d-23c28af20d9d,"It's a very nice residential neighborhood to live and raise a family.  The homes are well maintained and the gardens are very neat.  In the summer there are lots of beautiful flowers and shrubs.  Lots of family barbecues take place and kids play out in the streets or in the local parks.  There are also lots of block parties, with people having fun."
Cambria Heights_f5db789f-eb0f-4391-88d6-62f09d5a9888,"Cambria heights is a nice area of Queens to live in. There is not of crime. It actually a very peaceful area to live in."
Cambria Heights_554924fd-c97f-48b3-b3a6-b00d6a884198,"Cambria Heights is a very nice residential neighborhood of all privately owned homes.  This neighborhood is full of families, young and old, who want a more suburban lifestyle, without being too far from the City.  The schools are excellent with high academic achievements.  There are several places of worship, to suite all denominations.  There are nice playgrounds for young children and youth.  There are also good eating places in the neighborhood, which are very moderately priced.  Unfortunately, there is no real night life here, just a couple of Bars, if you like that kind of thing.  Transportation is very good, with easy access to buses, trains and highways.  The quality of life here is one of the best in NY and the median household income is also one of the highest.  I'm glad I live in Cambria Heights."
Cambria Heights_ef3cb0d5-ad49-499b-9ed6-908d79896cf0,"There is a strong sense of community . All the children seem to play together nicely outside . Neighbors often borrow things from other neighbors. Everyone greets everyone they see. Its a quite pleasant place"
Cambria Heights_ae783893-dda3-47c6-a969-b1b5387fcd69,"Its a safe family friendly neighborhood. I never witnessed or heard of any crimes too close to home. Theres alot of children playing in their yards."
Cambria Heights_c49f6b23-3790-4bd2-b86c-852b496ff7c0,"This is the area I grew up in. I would have no problem staying in the neighborhood to raise my own children. But i plan on moving out of my mother's house and can not see being able to afford it right after college."
Cambria Heights_87f9562c-8322-4cd0-a8b6-1ac56ab091b0,"This is an area of all privately homes with no apartment buildings.  It's relatively same and people tend to live here for a long time.  The property value is one of the highest in NY and the schools are excellent.  This is American living in a large town at its best."
Cambria Heights_3c647613-4695-4ad8-9982-c65780c9dcb0,"My community is one of the nicest  in New York.  People take pride in their front gardens and the general appearance of their homes.  In the summer you can smell the barbecues taking place in the gardens.  Some people say it's too quiet for them because they're not use to living in a residential community.  But for me it's perfect."

Cambria Heights_37080d93-6ea4-4a7b-85d9-04bc95242aba,"It's NY and you can never be too safe.  I feel safe but crime happens everywhere.  It's very low in my neighborhood though."

Cambria Heights_a86789aa-dcb4-430a-9f20-95dddb59fe02,"Being that there is not much in the area jobs are very limited."
Canarsie_bf0554e9-9044-4b43-a3eb-9c08b0e46d5f,"I appreciate how close the malls and markets are to the neighborhood. You can easily find clothes, produce, and tools in the neighborhood. What I would like to see change is the liquor store that is located on Seaview Avenue. During the warmer months it attracts low class people and there have been a few times where they came into Canarsie's residential neighborhood and caused a bit of disturbance"
Canarsie_3f35d8b7-f7fd-4ba6-bbb8-9515348475d0,"It's a quiet town in Brooklyn that needs more diversity and unity with other races. They are bad parts of Canarsie and fairly good and quiet parts of Canarsie. I lived here all my life (18 years) and I feel like it is a nice town to live and thrive in however, I do not see my self living here in the future because of the lack of diversity. Canarsie can be a wonderful place if different communities involved themseleves with the singular African American race which residents here. At first the people may seem scary and rough but after you say hello they can be friendly and kind. Just remember this is Brooklyn. You must always keep your guard up regardless show nice someone is to you."
Canarsie_6fee4800-6e4c-4f15-b094-634099a55f6c,"The neighborhood is pretty good and well kept. We have our own security through spring creek and provides neighborhood watch.  We have a mall not too far away and easily accessible by public transportation. There are 2 supermarkets in the area as well as access to fast food restaurants and a few diners.  It is a little expensive to live here, but overall it is a pretty safe neighborhood."
Canarsie_96d6d298-e8dc-4eb5-8e64-d77e7a448a60,"This is a safe neighborhood with many parks in the area for children to play at. There are many convenient stores, laundromats, beauty salons/nail salons, and day cares around."
Canarsie_9be2031c-b399-40ff-8e0f-b501548d6ad8,"Very quiet in the hundreds. Easy access to MTA busses and the L train. Pharmacies, restaurants,liquor stores all within walking distance."

Canarsie_68eb4399-3527-4c11-a077-c6739c094818,"The housing in the area are nice but they are too expensive. There not much vacant or abandoned properties in the community. It is not the best place to live but its a good place."
Canarsie_fa6d97f5-70b5-43a6-9cbc-73bef71dd1da,"Most people in my community are homeowners. Some of them are friendly while some are not."
Canarsie_6e2b7f9d-5b33-4bd4-8366-a5a562b83590,"I feel like the police and the community should work together to reduce the crime rate."

Canarsie_52a37a17-89f4-42b6-8372-b196e319f960,"I was robbed once at knifepoint, but other than that I haven't had any other issues. There are quite a bit of registered sex offenders in the area."
Canarsie_fdcd7541-29d9-4b71-99b3-79038ba22e6b,"Unfortunately, due to Hurricane Sandy and living right by the river that flows into the Jamaica Bay, it caused a lot of flooding damage to our home. But, the government did provide assistance in fixing up some of issues caused by Hurricane Sandy. The crime rate in the area is okay, I just do not like the fact there a quite a bit of sexual assault residents living in the area. Other than those two cons, the area is quiet with great access to public transportation as well as the park, pier, and a recreation center."
Canarsie_45b54895-4a72-4577-b99c-ba717f9411ed,"Police patrol is okay especaily during the summer time"
Canarsie_2458eb1a-8152-4241-a628-e2f94d9cf628,"Its okay, Its not too far from the L train station, B17,B82, and B6. But the cost of living is expensive."
Canarsie_7fefba47-8184-46a7-96cb-65c4ddd6d9b9,"I love living in this area. My neighboorhood is quiet and most of the neighbors get along. There is rarely any crimes committed and if so its only misdemanors not any major offense. I would definitely chose to live here again."
Canarsie_4c087f81-a198-4bae-93fd-0ff0fd7d44ef,"Not much crimes but in other parts there are some here and there . Overall is safe"

Canarsie_5dd05735-70a2-48c6-bc51-1dfcbc177c1d,"I've been living in this neighborhood all my life and there's not much to say about it. As a predominately African-American community, it is definitely better than most of the stereotypical projects and ghettos you hear about, but it isn't as nice as say Park Slope. It's just fairly average."
Canarsie_bd8ad482-71f3-48c9-b34c-3561613e250e,"The are is not the worst, you just have to get use to the area."
Canarsie_7b2206bb-754f-413a-a62c-ea82276be8cb,"A lot of gangs and rent is increasing."

Canarsie_03701184-01e5-4fe7-b4b4-ef33a5fbeef6,"Its like any other neighborhood"
Canarsie_633e6ff0-aed3-4108-8651-169aab143fbc,"The housing around here is pretty great. There aren't much vacant or abandon properties and the cost of housing and utilities are at the expected rate."
Canarsie_056c7c5f-372f-4ccf-b8dd-fb4fccef36b4,"This area is very pet friendly. There isn't much of a community here because everyone keep to themselves. For the most part people tend to live 5 plus years around here."
Canarsie_6871b83f-31e4-4995-a6cb-821bebf9e86b,"There are rarely any crimes in this area. I feel very safe and comfortable. I have no concerns when it comes to the police because if there is any issues, they arrive right away and they are responsive."
Canarsie_6bfc39a7-fbc2-496a-98ac-a36f9b106348,"One thing that I really love about my neighborhood is that it's a peaceful working class neighborhood where I can look forward to resting at night. Theres a pier that I love to go to unwind with a little sight-seeing or kayaking. Just a few blocks away there's the Canarsie park and it includes a skate park as well as a cricket field/baseball field that have 3-4 games daily (You can tell which is which because each team comes in their signature uniform). What I do see in the future for this area is possibly more bus routes because more and more people are moving here as the years go by."
Canarsie_03cf74a0-b9ff-4a7a-bec4-e83927f666a5,"Canarsie, Brooklyn is a nice area for being in Brooklyn. I am originally from Long Island, NY, so I am used to the suburban lifestlye. With that being said, there are a few things I could complain about, like the huge, unsightly, and bright police lights on Flatlands ave. Or the terrible roads that run through the lower income parts of NYC. I've also had personal issues with the lack of stores and restaurants with HEALTHY options, fresh/GOOD fruit, and vegan/vegetarian options. Besides those and a couple of other things, the area isn't such a bad place to live. For one, it is a nice neighborhood to live in if you have children because there are plenty of schools nearby and lots of other families with school aged children. Also, while the huge bright plice lights on Flatlands don't look so great, they (along with the million and one police officers on that road at any given moment) do help keep the violence and crime as low as possible. 

Compared to the other places I've lived, including many different towns on Long Island, New Jersey, Upstate NY, The Bronx, California and other parts of Brooklyn, this area isn't the best, but definately isn't the worst place to live either. If I had a chance to do things over, although it wouldn't be my first choice, I wouldn't mind living here again."
Canarsie_820f5be9-5883-45b7-8c55-b1e3c1b20685,"The area is a great area to raise a family"
Canarsie_496ac612-7b81-4413-bf29-dbf5634a5f0c,"This area is what you makes of it. Although certain things could be improved to make it the best it could. I do not have much to complain about"
Canarsie_5de4a3b4-79df-4094-afd6-e308b5dece93,"The quality of life is nothing special. It really is what you make of it. It can be very loud at times and crime rates are going up so it can feel unsafe at times. However, it is my home and where I grew up so I am not too bothered by it."
Canarsie_3cc7cfed-4abf-46f0-9fcd-6cd4e1858801,"Public housing is surround by all the same walking vegetables. They offer no sense of motivation as a community."
Canarsie_1a63fb28-7357-4a3b-a43e-3add7f600865,"This is the best place there is hardly any criminal activity in my area and the neighbors are calm and don't get into fights. Yes we don't have the best transportation but most people in this area have cars and the transportation is a walking distance its just a a little limited."
Canarsie_c53ac5d7-99c7-4b77-bcd7-136814afa5c5,"There are several health and fitness facilities available and while they are used adequately, its mostly by the working young and active.  Most people above 35 don't appear to visit these facilities to support a healthy lifestyle.  Hospital care is available in three close facilities, but the sheer number of people in the community make a visit to these facilities take quite a bit of time.  The level of care provided is at best adequate due to the pressure placed on treating the abundance of patients.  I do a daily workout routine while at work and a bit more at home after work."
Canarsie_b2352e42-fab9-4612-aa81-e1f18be79fc3,"There are many houses in the area with multiple family dwelling in them.  They are very close together with some backyard space that is usable.  Most of this space is usually well kept with very few abandoned lots.  The quality of these houses are about average with very few abandoned.  The cost of utilities are very high in the area.  Electric rates seem to be about 2x the national average.  Gas is about average.  Housing cost for rent and mortgages are very high and so is insurance for housing and vehicle due to the abundance of vehicles."
Canarsie_830d3a3e-576c-4028-8368-f7161b75f078,"The crime level in the area is not very high for severe crimes, but petty theft crimes are probably about average.  Incidence of gun violence are not too frequent but do exist, while more serious gun related crimes are not very frequent.  In the past 18 years there have only been a handful of people whom i know that have any such type of contact."
Canarsie_f18dbaa0-1afd-47d7-b888-280e35c33ef9,"This area is never very severely affected by weather.  The very worse conditions occur in the winter with ice and snow storms.  Since a variety of people in the community use public transportation to get around, if they are running then most people will carry on their daily activities regardless of the weather conditions.  Spring, Summer, and Fall seasons usually present very few challenges to most people in the community."
Canarsie_b6032642-43c8-4624-a2ab-ae238f6e3538,"There are a variety of restaurants in the community as this is probably one of the greatest job opportunities.  There are a significant number of people in the community from the Caribbean islands and so the restaurants represent their food choices.  The quality of restaurants vary from hole-in-the-wall to very good eateries with ample room for karaoke and dancing entertainment."
Canarsie_e95d46c4-eeb4-4c21-9a9e-0c41eed249d8,"While, a job can be obtained in the area, the pay grade will not allow for anything above below average lifestyle.  There will be very little opportunity for home ownership for most people who work in the community.  As a result most who are qualified seek work opportunities in higher paying areas.  In addition for those with college level degrees, there are limited opportunities to get work assignments in this community."
Canarsie_45fa818d-f270-418c-84e3-03c87b66dbbf,"The average businesses in the area are not very technically oriented and limited in providing guidance for most things beyond day to day repairs.  In addition, no digital services are available that will allow the customer to seek online support.  However, there are a vast number of stores in the community that will provide just about any type of service that is needed, from auto repair to home plumbing and boiler repairs."
Canarsie_2d03c88a-6413-49cc-a780-eac2b2b828bc,"Not a lot of things to do."
Canarsie_1a9e9b11-f39e-4f64-8bb1-2d6c5b777dc9,"There are not many job opportunities to choose from even with a high education level."
Canarsie_c486f800-3a9c-414d-82f2-794c4e07cd87,"Does not have many varieties to choose from."
Canarsie_cc6f9f6c-b33a-4801-a900-9327a984a5e3,"where I live, I never heard of any crimes such as murder, burglary etc.... My neighbors are very respectful and kind. And often we see the cops just passing by in their car just like a regular day ."
Canarsie_211dee50-1f45-4314-b7fe-78de850cfa65,"its okay a little busy at time but no biggie at all"

Chelsea_f9c067e9-0340-460f-88c8-5e3e8bcb0def,"I have been a Chelsea resident ever since I was 9 years old. Chelsea has a small town mentality, but a big town atmosphere. Night life is nonexistent, but it is a pleasant place to stay."
Chelsea_ff3d3286-ae20-4c90-bf2c-8c3f9622c99f,"I love the highline,and all the new high rise buildings under new construction. The west side of Manhattan and the Hudson is really changing the skyline and the community."
Chelsea_4d301d9e-ca00-40e1-ac29-bf52b94da1e9,"There is a lot going on in the area between tourists, and those heading to the office, however, it is an area of Manhattan that has something to offer. Chelsea is home to the world famous Madison Square Garden (MSG) and Pennsylvania Station (Penn Station). It is also home to the High Line Park- which is an abandoned railroad track that has been renovated into a park (great views). Chelsea is also known for its Fashion District, with streets of fabric and trim shops, to the world famous fashion university, Fashion Institute of Technology. The area also has many historical buildings- like the historical US Post Office on 8th Avenue. It is a more saturated area of Manhattan, and is rather safe."
Chelsea_275a17ce-bf09-44b6-a57a-5ab21f500ace,"Chelsea is a great area to live. Lots of places to eat and streets are never crowded. Also, tree lined streets are definitely pretty all year round!"
Chelsea_fa6e648b-301c-4529-902d-70faebe4956d,"I have to start by saying that I cannot attest to the public school system here as I do not have kids....

I have lived in Chelsea for 4 years, and it is one of the most convenient neighborhoods in Manhattan to live in. Close to almost all subway lines, you can be in to Downtown, Brooklyn, Queens or the UWS in 20 minutes or less. Everything I need logistically is within a 5 block radius: Whole Foods, Planet Fitness, my yoga studio, Madison Square's dog park, commercial shopping on 6th ave, dozens of independent coffee shops and restaurants. Not much for nightlife (in my opinion) but great places to eat.

It's expensive, but it's Manhattan. It's relatively safe, but like any urban neighborhood there are incidents. Homelessness was on the rise in Summer 2016."
Chelsea_2010efad-0bf2-4f1b-99d6-071638b3278f,"I have moved here, to Chelsea from Western Massachusetts to attend college and I absolutely love this neighborhood! It is kept very clean, is consistently overseen by police officers in the nearby station, and very family-friendly. There are lots of food variety options; everything from your guilty fast food pleasures to organic & vegan choices as well. The streets are very easy to navigate and if you are unsure, there are always residents who are willing to help & answer any questions! It is a bustling, fast-moving community and a great choice for anyone with the similar lifestyle!"
Chelsea_b468c239-4064-40c1-a312-43d17901a1aa,"I love my neighborhood to the core. I've spent my entire life here and watching it grow has only been both exciting and slightly scary. "
Chelsea_65c61077-ec77-470f-9902-64ada934e8bb,"Amazing neighborhood in New York, so vibrant, close to tons of amazing bars, restaurants, shops, and sites, and it's easy to get to the path along the Hudson for running and biking. Don't let someone try to rent or sell you a place above 23rd and call it Chelsea, it's not, and if you live west of 9th avenue it's going to a long walk to get to any subways. "
Chelsea_e25bd98f-7325-486b-b076-53b2065b3e0c,"Its not a very bad neighborhood, if you are looking for tranquility and a neighborhood where its safe to be outside more often this would be it."
Chelsea_bb5beb9e-beb0-4029-a2e5-9b1eb95cec3b,"Although pricey, it is a great neighborhood if you are looking for diversity, culture, and an easier commute to and from work. Transportation is not bad as there are different train and bus lines that pass through the area. There are plenty of cultural spaces and events to engage in."
Chelsea_f1b4e97e-a5ed-4bcf-ad74-3f32eaeb3d0f,"I love my neighborhood. I would live here again, it has a great physical appearance and atmosphere. People are mostly friendly. Although questionable characters often linger on 8th avenue between 17th and 23rd."

It's quite simple to navigate, that's if you know your avenues and streets, and everything is close by. Subsequently, I would rather live in the Upper Sides of New York, because of its beauty and authenticity."

Chelsea_8d33d01e-f383-4fc6-850d-cdf9b69bdf2a,"Because of the large verity of businesses in my area, finding a job does not seem too difficult. However, many places do not say whether they are hiring or what positions are open."
Chelsea_1374df15-5109-4611-b702-f40f8e74a3bd,"There are a good amount of local businesses around my area, however, they have been at a decline for some years now. This is because of the rising taxes and property costs make opening and running a small, independent business a lot harder than it used to be.  The end result is numerous big business stores but a decreased amount of smaller stores"
Chelsea_05d1d6af-04a1-454c-b873-8b003b90bbe4,"Everyone lives in apartments, so there isn't much greenery, but there are a lot of awesome buildings around. Housing is very expensive, though, particularly in this area"
Chelsea_7315d934-0470-4090-afb0-bc0126bfd0f9,"It's a large city, so there's bound to be some crime, but it hasn't impacted me negatively and my neighborhood is fairly safe, even at night."

Chelsea_57c11ba4-f018-4006-a00c-e2b8dfd163b6,"It's pretty cold in the winter and very hot in the summer, but with the right winter coat and air conditioning, you can handle anything."
Chelsea_5f76026e-5017-4382-a00c-5c5b1aa01496,"There are so many amazing places around to eat and grocery shop at. Bars have fun events like trivia night, unlimited brunch opportunities, and delicious food for all budgets."

Chelsea_414f17f0-6bf8-45b9-8e8f-0400505343e6,"Trader Joe's is the best grocery store I've ever shopped in - everything is cheap and delicious. There are tons of convenience stores on every block, great for buying toothpaste or a midnight snack. Tons of amazing restaurants - Thai at Republic, teriyaki at Glaze, salads at Chopp'd, brunch at Penny Farthing or Brazen Fox!"

Chelsea_cdbf5d6e-0bd9-4736-b216-bdc7a215338a,"Thing is I generally buy from big companies like CVS, Rite Aids, Duane Read. I dont really see mom and pop shops"
Chelsea_96b646d2-3d79-4bf3-bc7f-4c85dd095217,"New York is fairly temperate but the effects of climate change can be felt. Especially with hurricane Sandy many New Yorkers became aware of how vulnerable they were to flooding. We've experienced more violent storms in recent years. Overall the fall and spring are the most amenable to everyone. In the winter everyone's in a rush to make it from one warm building to another and in the summer with all the metal, glass and concrete the hear can become oppressive. But overall the weather in NYC is pretty great."
Chelsea_a4a6a0e4-16b1-447c-95d4-a931b998e8d3,"New York and especially the Chelsea neighborhood has amazing nightlife, and restaurants. The only are where it can fall short is price point although it can be a matter of opinion how expensive something is and often the more affordable options are pretty low key local spots."
Chelsea_d832ea8e-f412-4b00-8d8c-55904e6dd1dc,"There's a fair number of politically active people in the area and there's a fair number of disaffected individuals who don't care. Almost everyone has some cause though. Whether its local community or political or environmental. Almost everyone has an activist streak for their own cause."
Chelsea_2a43fac5-efaf-45ac-85f9-111632600178,"New York actually has some of the best tap water in the country and so drinking from the tap is perfectly acceptable. We get our water from reservoirs upstate some of which are currently being threatened by fracking. Otherwise it's a fairly clean city with its own fair amount of litter and pollution as is to be expected of a city this size."
Chelsea_c3f90380-303e-4f35-8d35-9d835b14d143,"New York is definitely not the life for everyone but for a lot of people the fast paced life and overall bustling nature of the city is perfect. The quality of life is good if you know how to balance life and work and when and where and how to slow down to smell the roses. It can be hard to put the rush aside which does get to a lot of people but its not impossible."
Chelsea_82973faa-f6a0-4996-81a6-f087d3d8caa8,"As cynical as New Yorkers may be cynical we on average do have pretty great public services."
Chelsea_ef226512-7154-458a-83e2-8199e24e22ad,"The transportation available in New York is the best. The only downside is that the number of people using it causes its own issues. Cars are a problem during rush hour, trains get crowded, buses get crowded, every thing is there its just a matter of timing your way around a big rush."
Chelsea_ec4860b2-4838-4988-a87b-509b09cd4736,"It's New York. There's Madison square garden for the huge events. There's innumerable number of small venues for independent artists. There's comedy clubs, art museums and galleries, dance theaters, music shows, you name it its in New York."
Chelsea_f89069b2-9fe0-4773-b3f3-7e09032bed34,"Chelsea has very limited crime and is generally a safe neighborhood. While the police aren't always visible they're around when called. In any situation however its more important to be aware, and be safe in when and where you're walking. A little but if street smarts goes a long way in staying safe."
Chelsea_8db3e30b-3e8a-43e0-924e-8607df0b6124,"The job market is fairly disparate in New York. There's a decent number of minimum wage jobs working in the service industry (cashier, waitress, etc.) and there's a fair number of internships for college students who are looking for experience in the field (although because its New York almost all of these are highly desirable and competitive) then there's jobs in your field of interest that are usually fairly difficult to find. But jobs are scarce everywhere so New York is hardly an exception. It's the cost of living that makes the minimum wage jobs hard."
Chelsea_55914a39-daa4-4784-89f0-f76066ebc8d2,"I can't say what goes on behind closed doors but for the most part there are few displays of obviously drug or alcohol abusing individuals in public. There's the occasional homeless person but its not very frequent or on every block. In terms of fitness there's always people biking in the bike lanes or running nearby."
Chelsea_82de8f26-9003-4928-a047-b66e90f0cf53,"It's Chelsea. There's gay people. It's New York. There's every race, religion, and background. The only thing that New York is short on is conservatives and poor people. Conservatives because its New York. We're pretty freakin liberal. Poor people definitely live in New York but the high cost of living, especially in this neighborhood, often excludes those of a lower socio-economic class."
Chelsea_3bfab6cd-061b-4bcb-89b5-bc894e2da67b,"Chelsea has the absolute best variety of stores. There's a large number of small businesses that do everything from bagels (A true sign of a good neighborhood. Any New Yorker can tell you a neighborhood is only as good as the bagels you can get there) to coffee and restaurants are amazing. There's of course the requisite number of chains from McDonald's to Starbucks and probably a odd number of health supplement stores (vitamin shoppe, GMC, whole body). In terms of availability of places to go and things to do Chelsea is the absolute best."

My area is very friendly with the kids on the block playing together.  It's definitely good times during the summer where we have cookouts where all of our family and friends come over and sometimes we put up the movie screen and watch games. I love my area."
Clason Point_4adc34e0-4a44-4e92-8679-4ecd421ecb3a,"It's actually very hard to get housing here as you need to be making a certain amount in order to be eligible to get an apartment but once that is over they just charge you based on what you're making, which if i recall is 10% of what you make but i'm not exactly sure. Other than that I haven't seen any abandoned properties or anything like that."
Clason Point_384e7d5a-11de-4503-ae03-a6bcf6bb6468,"Most of the community is Hispanic and/or African but we all pretty much get along with each other. I wouldn't say that we get together necessarily, it's more like we would help each other if we see they need help and just have proper manners like saying good morning, or holding the door for people behind us. But they mainly stick together with people in their culture. We all pretty much have the same economic situations, so we pretty much 'get' each other in terms of needs and just, we don't judge each other based on that. Overall, it's a pretty good community and we pretty much have our own rules and follow them and because of that we live peacefully."
Clason Point_031b30af-14b2-4e5a-a019-06d24b4831db,"I've never had a problem with crime or safety concerns in the area that I live in. Police officers around my area are very cooperative."

As well as people who don't  even live here, coming in so easily. But now no one can stay outside past 10 and if you don't have  your keycard, you would have to sign in with an ID and tell the security  what building your going into and apartment. They also installed  new cameras and there are more police around when it starts to get late and if the crowd outside starts to get big, they separate  them."
Clason Point_6fb98c4e-0ad3-495c-bae9-c1b71eb5f575,"There's  lots of nature and we literally  have a ball one block away with multiple  stores and if we walk a little there are a bunch of restaurants and fast-food places.

Clason Point_6ad37e9a-70de-4cb7-beb3-3d9a8e28b2c6,"My neighborhood is very family oriented. Everyone on that block has lived there from generation to generation. The only downfall is that it's far from the subway. You must take the bus which stops running after a certain time,  otherwise Commonwwealth is a very quiet and safe neighborhood."

They are with in walking distance of each other. However it is a terrible place if you own a car, you really cant find parking and you really have to pay attention to the signs posted where you park or else you will be ticketed and towed away. I see white people !"

Clason Point_098768d5-cce4-4d5d-aee9-55f51199c409,"I would say this community is a mixture of middle and working class. Most are professional by trade.

Clason Point_cffbc336-a231-4dfb-9988-9ac8b3543239,"Aside from your normal teenage hooligans, I would say the neighborhood is pretty safe. I see police officers patroling on a daily basis. Theres a good amount of people walking around. Local stores have state of the art survaillance. Children are pretty safe going and coming from schools"
Clason Point_249d091d-c358-4945-bb22-5e94a9a742de,"I will describe my overall experience in my living situation as very good, everything is pretty much convenient for me.

Clason Point_29fefb94-3f8d-4fd0-b785-fe3e4164740a,"The general atmosphere during the day is okay. At night it gets dangerous especially with all the gangs that are against each other in the area. It is not a place where I would choose to live if I had the choice. The level of safety within the buildings are safe but annoyingly so in that we need special cards to get in and out. The elevators are always broken and the washing machines take extra long to dry clothes. A lot of dangerous activity have been going on lately like men bringing younger girls into the building, gambling, smoking. Sometimes, I can smell the smoke get in through the door into my apartment. I hope to move me and my family out one day."

Clason Point_9a555ad3-940d-4a83-86ed-5cf0cde2a963,"It's close to transporatation, Police Department, Fire Department and Supermarkets. Its pretty comfortable for people with kids, especially with the Park we have next door to us. I just wished, they would finish the rebuilding of public recreational spaces faster than what the government has been doing. If i could live in a better area, safer and more private, i would."
Clason Point_bc23172e-646f-40f0-a4a8-b4735b9fc117,"There are barely enough police around in my neighborhood. In addition their has been many shootings as well as people being shot to death right in front of my complex. However police are yet to show their face until hours after. In addition, there are many robbery's as well drug dealing. To my knowledge the safety in my community needs to be increased tremendously."
Clason Point_8977e204-7c4e-4c27-821a-96282cbcc645,"Public service in this area is not up to date. If you call the police, you will not get a response from them within hour. They tend to take their time when circumstances are severe. In addition, I do not a agree with certain laws such as stop and frisk. It contradicts an amendment in the constitution and I believe that everyone is entitled to withhold their rights."
Clason Point_d13b512e-33c3-4a44-b10e-6faaf182585a,"The weather in this area isn't severe. There are occasions where there might be thunderstorms or flooding if it rains too much. However there are drains on the streets in which the water may go away. There has been instances where it would snow and they would not clean up the snow and one would fall and hurt themselves. In addition, I usually wear jeans and a coat and boots in any severe weather. At least anything that would keep me warm for the moment."
Clason Point_4dbd0a4f-9fcd-492f-8f73-284f9199ef0d,"I am underage therefore I do not drink, however I do tend to go out to eat. There are usually chain restaurants where I reside. Therefore, there isn't anything unique to the taste of the food. However, there are a few late night food options such as Chinese food stores, as well as pizza shops or delis. However certain places may have a low score for being sanitary therefore not many would like to attend. In addition, it isn't high quality and at times families would like a difference in scenery when they go out."
Clason Point_efbfbb0d-e067-4a7a-b740-37bdcdeb5873,"There isn't enough employment in this area. Most people either become a caretaker or settle for a minimum wage paying job. At times people have no other choice and they start to sell drugs. Others decided to take their businesses into their home. They would either do cosmetology at home or even try to design clothes that they may like. In my community most have yet to complete high school and haven't even went for a GED."
Clason Point_fef31db1-a806-48b9-b985-f6b45c3c9b43,"In the area I live, there are mostly minorities. Therefore, not many obtain a job nor have a high level of education. In addition, most live based on their public assistance therefore do not have the money to own a business. However, there are a few grocery stores as well as a pharmacy and supermarket. There are a few business that make more than others based on the products that they sell or violence that has occurred in the area. In addition, there has been many circumstances in which businesses but they have failed to gain a profit and eventually had to close down. There are many things that you may need that you have to travel for and that's if you have the money  to travel. It is difficult surviving in this area."

Walk down Myrtle and stumble upon a new restaurant boasting southern-caribbean fusion, next door to your favorite, dingy, dive-bar hosting trivia night to the local Pratt students. Across from your auto garage, is the array of supermarkets that make the Manhattanites swoon in jealousy over affordable hand soap. And while being situated south of Williamsburg and north of downtown Brooklyn, centered in the most expensive real estate in the New York city, the rent has mysteriously stayed low enough for the diverse community to live comfortably. The mix of native Brooklynites, students, and Manhattan by and Brooklyn homeowners by night, keeps the Wednesday night softball league interesting; the high rise luxury apartments going up next to the Hasidic owned bakery from 1928 keeps it truly Brooklyn."

With the various different backgrounds in this city, people all come to a park and relax. The schools here are pretty good, but there's only primary schools. I love the somewhat cheap prices around here!  There's nothing more cheap than the deli near here, but at the same time, some deli's nearby are also pretty expensive. So, it goes both ways. I grew up here and I love this place!"

A local movie theater and shopping mall complete the scene."

College Point has an amazing history but it seems that the people moving in are making it worse.  Every year, low quality people are moving in.  Home owners are moving out and renting anyone.  Since they don't live there, they don't care if the tenants are nosing or bad.  The youth in College Point is either non-existent or mediocre.  There are few kids who are good, don't use or sell drugs, or are causing trouble.  You won't see the good kids hanging around College Point.  College Point either smells like sewer poop or marijuana, neither of which I like.  Where have all the good people gone? Away.  Social atmosphere?  Mostly every is or acts like a peasant.

The new developments being erected in College Point are causing the home prices to rise.  It's a good time to sell and move out to a better neighborhood.   Obviously College Point is better than Jamaica, but who wants to live there? 

I would not like to live here again."

Ever since the police academy has been established, the excessive amount of policing have increased and people are afraid to drive in my neighborhood due to the terrible roads and absurd ticketing. Rather than crimes being an issue, I honestly believe cops are the problem as I was nearly hit just strolling down my block due to some speedster rushing into the academy which would not be acceptable behavior from any normal citizen."

Concourse Village_32a62382-f26e-4cbb-8142-480539b68ac8,"The reason why I applicably gave a considerably low rate on crime and safety on my community is because, police protection is moderate and crime occurrences are very high. In the past four months, there has been two murders, one armed robbery incident, and a rape case. When these serious crimes occurred, the FBI investigated the crimes and questioned the neighborhood. That lasted only for a week. When the investigations were over, the FBI assigned only a handful of Police Officers to be on neighborhood watch for two weeks. After the Police Officers duty to observe the neighborhood was completed, it was as if nothing ever happened. As soon as criminals saw that law enforcement were no longer roaming the streets, the shootings commenced. Every other week, as I tried to close my eyes to get a good night's rest for school the next day, I would be awaken by either loud quarrels or gunshots. How unlucky I would be if I heard both. It is a horrible experience living in a community where anything violent can unpredictably happen, even when there are small children around. When the summer arrives, I choose to not be around my neighborhood, primarily because a violent confrontation erratically tends to happen. I detest having to witness crimes happen right in front of me. I have seen Disputes turn into fist fights; men flirting with women end up battling their husbands in knife battles, and gang violence ends up disturbing the people of my community when they are outside trying to enjoy the summer breeze with their families. I trust that the more police we have protecting my neighborhood, mainly in the summertime, the less crime there will be."
Concourse Village_e1e141f3-6953-4ca2-8fa9-466c3767f00f,"Everyone on Earth lives with an endlessly-evolving, ever fascinating force called weather. Rain, sunshine, wind, how hot or cold it is, all make up what we experience everyday. The weather affects our daily lives in many ways. In my area, in summer and spring, sporting events like lacrosse and soccer rely on dry, somewhat warm weather. similarly, just as carnivals, festivals and even random block parties cannot continue if there is heavy rain fall and flooding. Gladly, the occurrence of natural disasters is not at all a concern where I live. Since I reside in an exceedingly urban community, I am not surrounded by bodies of water, which prevents hurricanes and other water-related hazards from occurring. Furthermore, because of the significant amount of buildings, there are less trees, avoiding consequential wildfires. In my opinion, winter is the best season. Primarily because when it is extremely cold, I stay home--wrapped up in my warm pink fleece blanket--choosing what I'm going to watch next on Netflix, while sipping on some deliciously, home-made hot-cocoa. All such great enjoyment without having to do much effort and go out some place elsewhere. If at anytime I am suddenly forced to visit relatives and leave my comforting partner, bed, I make sure to bundle up in my warm North face winter coat and swathe my neck with my favorable knit scarf. The weather is all around us, all the time; affecting the sort of activities we do, what clothes we wear, and where we would like to go for our holiday."
Concourse Village_f1676d70-6210-40d1-83dd-a21d6dbae4ca,"The local business in this area are very accessible and convenient to the residents of the Bronx. Almost anything can be acquired by just walking down a couple of blocks. There are a few pleasant clothing stores that provide customers a variety of different styles from all around the world--from Africa to India. There are also the supermarkets that allow customers to walk through the neat aisles and explore new foods and ethical choices while helping the consumers save heaps amount of money--Especially coupon hoarders. Whereas, the Chinese restaurants and fried chicken spots are pricey but the opportunity of being able to try different food combination ideas, at any given time,24 hours a day seven days a week, whenever you want, can be pretty exciting."
Concourse Village_99fabc45-ee72-4ea1-b26f-1fc32b1068d6,"As my grandmother always says, the Bronx has come a long way since the 1970's. Many investments have helped create new small businesses, which in turn has generated thousands of new jobs. There are limited--Yet successful businesses and markets, such as unisex salons , convenient and appliance stores, and grocery markets, which are not only easily accessible, but provides limited space for employment to the individuals in need of a job. The employment rate in the community is not significantly high, nor severely low. But job opportunities are very scarce. Everyday I witness at least one impoverished person sacrificing themselves in order to provide for themselves, and in most cases, for their families as well. Especially now in the winter there would be people who get paid to shovel in the harsh snow and homeless people gathering bottles and cans to receive at least $10 to get through the week. Which strikes strong sympathy upon me because these are the people of my community and I can do nothing but wish that they pull through the rough economy and find ways to improve themselves financially ."

Although many people enjoy and indulge on these tasty fast-foods, they are unaware how these foods can cause damage to their health if it is not eaten in moderation. Which has evidently led me to believe that my community's representatives should take more action into coming up with innovating ideas that could better the decisions of Bronx individuals in food choices."

Coney Island_597e6f2c-9e9e-4828-b0f2-913d3944a7a6,"I like that coney island is a image. It is very diverse. They have the best fast food places around, including the famous 'Nathan Hot Dog'.

Coney Island_00785be4-fe13-44be-aebc-eea4e83ee186,"Coney Island is sandwiched between the ocean beach and NY Harbor. You are never more than three blocks from the beach which is not crowded. There is lots to do by the beach for families: the boardwalk, aquarium, Luna Park, amphitheater, and MCU Park for baseball. There is not much to do outside of MCU Park, the amphitheater, and Luna Park after dark."

It's a huge park with basketballl court, an Olympic sized track, baseball fields, and a childrens playground. It's pretty clean"

Corona_d045c055-39b8-4a54-8e50-f7e8dbd39ac3,"Corona is vast and extremely diverse. I enjoy waking up to different sites and people everyday. There are many things to do and always a story to tell or be heard. As with everywhere the downside to this beautiful place is the uncompromising traffic during the holiday season."
Corona_0afa2ebd-45a6-490b-b470-a37c2146b650,"It is family friendly. There are many shops/markets in the area. Many cultures reside in Corona. It is a strong symbol of the melting pot of nations that represents New York."
Corona_fe9b50bc-a305-4fe3-bb14-aebb52288efa,"Corona is Lively neighborhood in the biggest Borough in the city. It's home to the Louie Armstrong House, The Lemon Ice King of Corona, The Hall of Science, and various points of interest.  you got Flushing Meadows Corona Park next door, home to the Billie Jean King Tennis center and Citi Field, home of the New York Mets. There are various shops and restaurants of many diverse cultures.  However, I wouldn't say that is the best Neighborhood in NYC. for one, for having a lot for schools, they are overfilled with very few schools funded properly.  There are more Primary schools but very few Middle schools in Corona.  Safety is all right. There are some crimes happening at times, but the police gets it r solved quick. overall it is an okay place."
Corona_c6c5c57e-6762-4692-93dc-dad8055f6a83,"One of the best neighborhoods to be at NYC. Friendly community. A very diverse community. I been living in Queens for 13 years and I feel so safe. I had never seen any gangs or bad people in our community."
Corona_f17ac003-1564-45ec-a79f-43a9e13abd67,"The neighborhood i live in is very challenging to me. Not many people go to college, most just work and earn their money. It is hard to live in a neighborhood where college is not really that important. Although this is a not a very positive thing it motivates me to do better in school so i could get a good job and move and help my family out."
Corona_861790bf-9f83-49b0-975b-fe16ac092ea0,"Corona isn't considered to be a great neighborhood but what I like about it is that it is very close to many different stores and next to a pretty big shopping mall. This neighborhood is loud at times which is a major conflict. Overall this neighborhood is developing and I enjoy living here. It is a very diverse neighborhood which is a very good thing ."
Corona_1d1f5651-4dc4-4911-a651-85555352a651,"THE BIGGEST PROBLEM for struggling communities is despair as everyone—inside the community and out loses faith that anything can change. The goal then must be to crack through that sense of hopelessness, showing that change is possible."
Corona_b0f8d4ae-654b-43e3-bded-d79bee5685bc,"It's great because it's nearby everything like subway, grocery stores and malls"
Corona_17c73b6d-541b-49c1-811a-78d522a6e574,"Police are always circling the neighborhood. I don't feel as if the community is safer with them constantly present and visible. I feel as though they are here constantly profiling young kids in the neighborhood (more often than not, stops don't result in arrests). I wish there was less police presence. They only bring a anxiety and a culture of fear to the neighborhood."
Corona_e44f1fb6-6165-49ce-9e9e-6e57718a7864,"I love Corona. I have lived here for as long as I have been in the united States and feel at home here. I went away to college about three years ago and every time i return I never realize how much I had missed it. I have a church just a five minute walk away, a grocery store, MTA bus, restaurants, schools, doctors, and stores, within a .1 mile radius. The only thing I wish were different were the limited amount of resources that my community receives to improve it."
Corona_3fa430d4-2a06-41b9-9b45-ca17dca42148,"Overall, Corona is a safe place.  Once in a while something does happen, but the authorities are quick to respond."
Corona_c4538da6-5591-4aa5-8270-1ccee081db04,"Nothing special about Corona, but there is nothing to complain about either.  There could be more events and attractions.  Flushing Meadows Park is nice."
Corona_db49bb14-3ebf-493c-8758-394d76217877,"Just Recently Some guy push a girl on to the tracks in the local train station. Other than that, the crimes in my neighborhood are minor."

Corona_7968888e-ab0b-4025-8171-5d1c5fefffb2,"I can't say that there is much crime. I don't even recall any crime happening. We don't see police much, just some glimpses of police cars passing by which does make this neighborhood feel a little safer."

Corona_2c5d6b8e-11d3-4574-8d46-0759845781ee,"Kids are still being arrested and treated badly, I know kids that have been in the block for more than 5-6 years and cops pass by them like they belong there, that's what's wrong with the system, they target us when we hurt others but they don't teach us how to get a decent job and when kids like us, ' minorities' try we get turned down because of our racial background or because we just don't know enough. They don't give us a chance and that's what makes us fail."
Corona_51d0fe3e-123f-44cd-9113-27a4e1125d26,"Well since I got to the country, we moved into my grandmas apartment and I automatically saw that the neighborhood was high on crime, and by this I mean I saw a lot of drugs circulating outside, a lot of kids my age selling them. However schools were always good and safe, I know for a fact my education was never endangered even if I went to the same school as those kids that were outside night and day selling their drugs. Crime rate never went down and cops were never around, it has been like this for the past 11 years from the time I was 10 until now, I am 21 years old and I still see the kids I grew up with, outside selling stuff. They are my friends but that doesn't mean I have to do the same, I love them, I grew up with them, poverty strikes in my community and I don't blame them, I mean there is only so many jobs in my community and nobody really wants to hire a kid ' without experience'."
Corona_ff1fb730-d556-46a3-979f-82f67d705234,"Only recently, before moving in 2014, crimes were rising in the neighborhood. Not too sure what it is like now, but certain streets absolutely need more street lights."
Corona_dddd336a-fb1d-42bb-901b-3a83474222ff,"It's certainly not the worst neighborhood, but residents generally do not curb their dogs, trash is often left on the streets, and crime is rising. There should be more street lights because some areas can get pretty dark. I do not see much changing in this area, I don't feel like there will be any change."

Corona_c99f8641-b9d0-4d67-bf84-f918041e0cd6,"I love the most part of my neighborhood, but there is a thing that I do not like. My neighborhood always somewhat dirty in the morning. I hope the cleanliness of the environment can get better."
Corona_0cb06fda-b43b-4db4-9b81-61cad097f15c,"Most of the homes/apartments have very similar architecture. The housing has become increasingly expensive unless you are on good terms with your landlord or have lived there for many years. Complaints are not usually addressed by the landlords and it's usually a problem for tenants. Housing once again, has become more expensive especially since new people with greater incomes are slowly settling in the area."
Corona_73606474-86bb-4693-9240-e215eef7db21,"Our sense of community is good. Everyone knows and respects each other. Th neighborhood has always been welcoming and hospitable to new neighbors. The community does not participate in community events, local elections, or support local teams because there aren't many opportunities to do so. Most of the community works full-time and thus do not find the time to take part in these events. Moreover, the government does not care too much for what the community wants and it's probably why hearing about and participating in town hall meetings or local elections is extremely rare."
Corona_88fc67d1-0786-4157-8f46-25401434cc2d,"The people and especially the youth in my neighborhood are not prone to crime and yet there is excessive police presence. Young kids are constantly being stopped and frisked or harassed by the police when they do not do anything wrong. The cops are responsive to any complaint that the neighborhood may have, mostly because the precinct is so nearby."
Corona_ab03024a-93e3-472a-a615-8f64d6f83452,"Living in Corona has been really great. I love the Latina/o community that lives there and cannot imagine myself anywhere else. There is a tight-knit community that I appreciate very much. Most important is how accessible the area is to food, public transportation, and school. There are grocery stores, and supermarkets at walking distance which is really great for this community who typically use public transportation and thus, don't drive. The bus is right around the corner from nearly everyone's homes. The great accessibility of public transportation has been especially key to making the people in this area happy.  Moreover, k-12 educational schools are all over the area. It makes parents happier to know that their children are going to school near the area and it made me happier to be close to home on my way to and from school."

There is one near my house and it is about 20 minutes far from my place, which is Flushing Meadow Park. I am loving it there, swimming and relaxing over my summer. The neighbor is really peaceful yet lively at the same time because of the neighbors integrity and exciting events they create each year. Overall, Queens is fantastic."
Corona_d5fbe3f2-759e-47c2-b838-0a303ce11dff,"It's alright the neighborhood as in the people who live here isn't where I feel like my little sister should grow up. I don't want her going to school with those kinds if bad influence kids so we had to go to a further away school."
Corona_0e4700c0-bfa7-4c96-a39c-d59e67ee729e,"I wish there was a public space for the resident to park their cars in Flushing-Meadows park since the residents around that area should get a little privilege because they are close to.

I will say that the government should built a new metro system underground so the people could go and get more easiler and on time to their schools and jobs.

I wish the government would worry more about the people to learn English.  Most of the resident Speak Spanish or other languages besides English and the government should help them since they pay taxes.  Equality so they also could give their opinions to the government"
Corona_e4e802a0-fda8-4fe9-b8cb-6095dfc43aae,"If i had the choice to live here again I would, only because its New York and theres nothing like it.

Crown Heights_c77898bb-39d3-4132-9e14-3d4203b620ab,"I've lived in crown heights for the last 11 years, I believe we are becoming more diverse and it's much safer than it was when I first got here. If it's anything I'd like to see change it's more of the people becoming move involved so we can build a stronger neighborhood for our children"
Crown Heights_06580f0f-2be8-4058-8137-2cd0448b0260,"Crown Heights continues to change daily it seems with new apartment buildings, restaurants, and bars. The area is safe and more slow-paced than other boroughs. With access to many of the major subway lines on Franklin Ave, one can easily access the rest of NYC."
Crown Heights_78579c5e-355e-4feb-9d3c-41927df47fb6,"Family area, very neighborhood-y feel. It's still down to earth and not too gentrified, but doesn't feel unsafe."
Crown Heights_620719ea-f389-4b3d-bf41-ec222dac13ce,"Crown heights is a very diverse neighborhood. It's filled with many small businesses and restaurants with quite tasty meals might I add...It's like a hidden gem right in the heart of Brooklyn with about a 30 min commute into the city."
Crown Heights_03c9249b-8f48-48a7-9565-f3338d1999d8,"I've lived in Crown Heights for the last 5 years and I've only had good experiences. Being one of the gentrified neighborhoods, it was easy for me to move in as rent was affordable. I lived right next to Franklin Ave, which has all the restaurants and bars. I was also only a 15-20 minute walk away from the Museum, Botanical Gardens, Public Library and Prospect Park. I had to to move further away because rent got really high in that part of Crown Heights. However, I managed to find a lovely apartment within a block away from the subway, so commuting to work only took about 30-40 minutes on the express train. Over the years, I've seen more grocery stores open up with a wider range of options that the local bodega. If you are a recent college grad or someone in your late 20s/early 30s, I would definitely recommend that you move to Crown Heights!"
Crown Heights_b5bbd80d-e32b-4e7f-b448-d009699db3b4,"I moved to Crown height from Washington, D.C. 4 years ago. Crown Heights is a diverse, family-oriented , clean, increasingly trendy area with a perfect density of restaurants, bars, and bodegas. It's a great area for young professionals. Great place to rent also."
Crown Heights_d16d78c2-f388-44ef-8a38-5094687f6e71,"Crown Heights right now is in a state of transition as a neighborhood as gentrification is in full force which has brought some positives such as bringing in new businesses and modernizing the neighborhood to a degree but one of the major issues is the cost of rent increasing dramatically forcing long time residents to move due to increased expenses. As the community becomes more diverse the rent is increasing and the biggest improvement i believe that should be made is stabilizing the cost of rent for the space of apartments and condos."
Crown Heights_be63b1bf-7409-46ab-8947-7fab77f9f09e,"Historic Crown Heights is a diverse and developing community. With rows of buildings dating as far back as 1800's and canopies of tall London Plane trees, it's easy to feel a sense of old New York stateliness and charm here. Franklin Ave, a popular strip full of restaurants and cafes has become a popular evening location for a drink with friends or a romantic dinner for two. The city is easily accessed by the A, C, 3, and 4 trains, but with beautiful locations like Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, the Brooklyn Library,  and the Brooklyn museum, you may not need to travel very far. Crown Heights is quickly becoming a go to spot for those who seek a more authentic New York experience in a neighborhood rich with cultural offerings."
Crown Heights_ac682cd2-6e06-4e9a-83f6-06c5f24f42bf,"I have lived in the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn, NY my entire life.  I would like to see quite a few changes - there could be more healthy food options around here, the streets and neighborhood can use some cleaning up itself and better school's for our children to attend. I don't think I have enough space to go on about the neighborhood, but I will start there. "

Crown Heights_ce5d0d2a-7202-4284-86d4-df5952c43fb2,"Crime maybe only happens once a year on my block and even then it isn't between people who live in the area. It's mostly people from other neighborhoods who come and start trouble. Most of the time it happens during the end of the summer and then you won't hear about anything for another year or so. Most people spend their time in doors after a certain hour, but during the summer everyone's outside just having a great time-- no drama."
Crown Heights_bf54d323-ce38-4ce2-8806-5b435b925fe5,"It's in a very quiet section of Crown Heights. During the 90s, Crown Heights was extremely crime infested, but now it has begun to change partly due to gentrification and Jewish property ownership. The block is extremely quiet and the neighbors are very friendly. Yes, it is still considered 'the hood,' but overall it is improving and flourishing. We even have trees and Fiji water!"
Crown Heights_ddc03e71-3c69-44f0-bd0a-e736ba1edf28,"As previously mentioned, there are drugs and people who sell in this area. They fight over customers I assume, and even one time there was a gun fight which left an individual shot twice on the stairs outside my building. I try to keep to myself in this area, I grew up with most of these people, but I do not like the path some of them have taken in life. I don't plan to stay here."
Crown Heights_0c95e14e-7fe6-4bef-9713-e91106837486,"This area does not particularly have a high crime rate, but needs massive improvement. There are gangs, even though they are less active then they are used to, they are still there. There are drugs in this environment, individuals who sell for profit. Every now and then there are gunshots outside. Besides for the drug problem, this area is run down, the pavements need improvement, and not much businesses open up over here. People who have businesses have remained the same for 15+ years."
Crown Heights_59c9d9c3-0452-4e4b-8851-98294517a21d,"The police are extremely on top of keeping the roads safe (they are constantly pulling people over for speeding). There tends to be more attention paid to areas AFTER an event occurs, especially near subway entrances and such. When there are accidents like hit and runs- the police can be very slow to respond. As far as the overall safety, there are certainly incidents that occur, but I feel as though it is dependent upon the time. When I first moved to the area in October (within a week), there was a police officer coming to our door to inquire about a robbery and assault that occurred at a gas station at our corner. The robbery and assault occurred between 2am and 5am. For me, there is no sense of safety past midnight, which makes me skeptical about looking for jobs that would require me to stay late."
Crown Heights_b15e7256-34cc-4ce7-a304-0bbab2059523,"I personally enjoy the area due to the amount of culture and and somewhat affordable prices of the apartments, but there has been the constant up and down struggle with gentrification within this neighborhood and many others around the city. The area I reside in is somewhat industrial and at times could be described as a bit run down.  In terms of necessities, transportation is always near by and there are grocery stores and small shops within walking distance. I feel if the community as a whole tried a little harder to keep the area clean and put a little more effort where they could, instead of letting the neighborhood continue to be run down- it could be a better place for all those in the area."

However, I have chosen to give the employment a four-star rating for two reasons.  One, I am not currently working in my desired field as I am in school so I do not have time to be a full-time paralegal.  With that being said, I do not know how easy it would be to obtain a job in my field so I cannot accurately give a rating on that point.  Furthermore, I work in Manhattan not Brooklyn.

My only complaint would be that their liquor store could use more wines from Upstate NY.  I find that to be a problem across the city though and not exclusive to this particular store which is why I have not docked them a star on this basis.  Not only were the quality of products excellent, but the service was as well.  The store was extremely busy yet they were still very polite to the customers and in an organized, friendly manner they were able to quickly move people along."

Crown Heights_005ec49f-8b8a-4332-a5e1-91baff31b92a,"Crown Heights is in the middle of some pretty blatant gentrification. As a result, many of the older stores of average quality are being replaced by stores that of a slightly higher quality. The newer stores don't really see a lot of traffic, because their would-be clientele is still, mostly, comprised of the friends/family/acquaintances of the people who had to be pushed out to make room for the new stores."
Crown Heights_42358d21-3abd-459a-b884-ac6287f2563c,"There are very basic businesses, and they are growing in variety and quality. No particularly exciting restaurants or options."
Crown Heights_7082b796-297d-402e-a283-507a4c881a28,"It's not a fancy or wealthy area. There's a lot of poverty, no one is well off, so it feels a little unsafe, but I've never seen any crime. Police are everywhere in the city, and I never feel like I'm in danger in crown heights"
Crown Heights_251d0a30-643a-4bdc-9627-ea01ec7ceb07,"I work in a restaurant, which is a job you can find anywhere. There are plenty of restaurant and retail opportunities in the metro area."

Crown Heights_0fd57f4c-defb-4598-918d-548a61e8c674,"The four seasons are summer, fall, winter, and spring. The summer can be extremely hot at times, so people usually have fans or an air conditioner. It also rains at times. However, it is nice to go outside without a coat. The fall is in between but getting colder, and the falling leaves make it pretty. The winter can get really cold some of the months, but I like the diversity of having some cold and snowy months. The spring is generally pleasant. Natural disasters do not generally occur, although it can sometimes get very cold in the winter. Some essential items in my wardrobe are my coat for the winter, some lighter clothes for the summer, some heavier clothes for the winter, and some in between clothes for a variety of types of weather. Boots are important, and I have an umbrella for the rain."
Crown Heights_8a676c03-7bd2-4c68-a2b3-029d37bd9d2c,"It's a great place to visit. It is not far from a lot of great tourist spots such as the Brooklyn Museum, the Botanical Gardens, and a zoo. It is also a few subway stops away from New York City, which is a major plus for tourists,. There is always something happening. Some people like to visit, but wouldn't want to live here, although others like the city. The biggest local events within NYC are endless, but around Crown Heights some people come for holidays or events. One time this happens is on is the Chof Beis Shvat, which is when Jewish women who come from all over the world come to pay their respects to the late Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka Schneerson of Lubavitch, who was the wife of the Rebbe of the Chabad Lubavitch movement. It is PACKED when they come!!! If you go to the women's section in '770' at that time, which is the main synagogue and is on 770 Eastern Parkway, you can't breathe it is so packed. If you think that is full, come back around September to the men's section of 770 and attempt to squeeze inside. Even the streets are full of people at that time of year because it is around the high holidays. These are some of the reasons people come from all over the world. As I mentioned, people may also come for other reasons such as the fun things to do such as the nearby Botanical Garden and the zoo."
Crown Heights_16b184af-652e-4ab7-88ac-8635cf113e8c,"There are a lot of crimes in Crown Heights because we do live in a populated area, and Brooklyn in general has a lot of crime. There is definitely a major police presence, especially on holidays or days where there are a lot of people in one place. There is Shomrim, which is a volunteer organization that helps when someone might try to beak into a car or some other crime happens. So there are crimes but there are police and other organizations in case something would happen."
Crown Heights_fa9d7975-e0da-42a3-87f0-80b6d145a668,"There are nearby workout facilities in and out of Crown Heights. I always see people jogging in the mornings or at other times. There are several doctor's offices in the area. They are very convenient, because they are within walking distance. There are great hospitals nearby. People in Crown Heights need this, because there is a lot of people here. I try to stay physically active, although sometimes I slack off. I take walks, sometimes do some exercises at home, and have even jogged sometimes although I don't do that much anymore. I may also try to take the stairs instead of the elevator for exercise if I have a choice."
Crown Heights_c921231b-5cc3-47dd-a10b-81ba0864c16b,"The food and drink are great. There are a variety of places to eat out with friends and family. However, sometimes restaurants can get very crowded, especially during some parts of the year when people are known to visit Crown Heights such as around September. People come from all over the world for the High Holidays to Crown Heights. The types of popular restaurants include meat restaurants, dairy restaurants, sandwich bars, places to stop by for  coffee, and more. I personally like eating out at pizza places, although meat restaurants do have their place. I like pizza. I am not that big on eating out. There are nightlife groups, but not that many that I know of. I do know that the variety of restaurants is excellent and plentiful, and one choice that many people go to is Bunch-O-Bagels, although there really are a lot of choices. Baked ziti is another of my favorite restaurant foods. If someone wants to avoid a crowded restaurant, they can order in. I think the food and drink here is great!"
Crown Heights_9a9b1f9a-f1b5-4a06-a722-6e555a14ef2a,"The police generally try to do what they can, and there is also Shomrim, a Jewish police force in case anything happens. The laws are many times rational, although the recent speeding law lowering the speed to 20 m.p.h. on Eastern Parkway may have been a little shocking to some. Personally, I don't usually drive, but I can see how it might be annoying to some people even if the government ids trying to regulate speed, which is a good thing. From what I heard, my Crown Heights local representative and the state representatives and governors are trying to do good things and be understanding. When people spoke to our representative Ms. Clarke she signed a petition to President Obama saying that he consult Congress to obtain its approval before striking a deal with Iran, she did sign it. I think the governors and representatives are just trying to do their job and seem to be doing alright. There are many public services such as charities, nursing homes, parks, etc."
Crown Heights_518aa18a-7354-4c2a-8377-752f70882ddb,"I would say there are some great parts about living here. There is easy access to public transportation and stores to buy basic necessities. There is a lot of people so that means a lot of activities going on which make it more exciting and less boring. If I could choose to live somewhere all over, I might live here because of the reasons I stated. Of course, if you are not Jewish or African American you might feel out of place, but that doesn't apply to me. I think living right near New York City definitely has some amazing perks so it is way better than many places in the country. I think the future for this area is great if it keeps up with the transportation, affordability, stores, etc."
Crown Heights_c3cd8e1a-e17f-4761-9c99-b1c0428e701f,"The safety for pedestrians/bicyclists is okay. It is not perfect because cars drive by a lot and people have to look out for that. The parking availability is really not that good. People can drive around for a little bit until they find something, although it is possible to get lucky and find a parking space. It is easy to walk to places because there are so many stores nearby that contain most things that people might need. Public transportation is good and usually reliable. Sometimes there are slight delays, but usually you can get to where you need to go without much trouble. Of course, if it is important to you to go somewhere at a specific time, you can go on the subway a few minutes early just in case there will be a delay. The website for the New York City Transit, which includes subway stops that run through Crown Heights, posts information about delays and changes within the subway system. There are congested areas because it is populous here, but people can definitely get to where they need to go by car. All in all, public transportation and walking is pretty good, although cars and congestion are not always that great."
Crown Heights_2a88bb35-438b-44a1-b290-ac55d556e4d3,"The employment in Crown Heights is okay. There are services to help people find jobs, but sometimes it can be hard. The employers in Crown Heights are probably the retail and grocery stores nearby. People here range in what they do for a living. There are students, teachers, writers, clerks, etc. If someone is looking for a job one place they can look is the local newspaper. Perhaps in Crown Heights someone may not find a job right away (although many do), but in case of that people can always work elsewhere in New York. Since New York is such a large and diverse place with so many industrial areas, people in Crown Heights have more jobs to choose from. Obviously it depends, based on the person's background and experience. However, people in Crown Height usually have choices, I suppose."
Crown Heights_f658eb1d-fe12-4df0-bff7-f61a1978d8b9,"There is a variety of many different types of people and age groups who come from different backgrounds. Some people are happy and friendly, while others can be grumpy ad rude, like anywhere else. There are mostly religious Jews and African Americans in the neighborhood. Many of the Jews are part of a group called Chabad because Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, who was the leader of this movement lived here until he passed away around 20 years ago. The African Americans have a huge parade every year called the West Indian parade and therefore they block off the streets on that day. The Jews also block of the streets for the Great Parade every year. Many of the people try to be friendly, both the African Americans and the Jews, and it is interesting and fun to live in a very diverse neighborhood."
Crown Heights_a1b2290d-d637-4faa-83f4-943f90becdd8,"The business are generally professional and reliable. There is a large variety of stores to choose from. I would say there are more smaller shops than big brand name companies. There is Crown Cosmetics, Little Toes, Flash Electronics, Sterling Electronics, and several restaurants. There are also hosiery stores, there is a Family Dollar, and there is a store that sells silver items such as wine cups and candlesticks. You can pretty much get just about everything you need in this area. If you wanted a computer or large appliances or furniture, you may have to go to a nearby Best Buy or Sears. You can also try a nearby Office Max for many of your office needs, although there is a small internet cafe and printing service within the Crown Heights area. It is great to have everything you need all in one place."
Crown Heights_ace535cb-28de-42e0-ad83-8eb797c4df04,"It's great. The prevalence of vacant or abandoned properties is low, but since Crown Heights has such a large population, people are always coming and going in case someone has a need to move in. People are always coming and going, which makes it a lot less boring. As for the quality of housing, it depends. Some houses are better than others. It is true that in some areas there are rats, but there are ways to keep them away so there are no rats! The cost of housing and utilities is generally good for renters although not as much for owners of houses. In my opinion, the better areas to live in Crown Heights include easy access to public transportation, stores, and wherever else you need to go - although obviously it should be somewhat clean. Some areas that may include many of these factors are around President Street and Nostrand Avenue or Sterling Street and Nostrand Avenue. There is also Kingston Avenue and Eastern Parkway. Actually all of Crown Heights technically has access to all of these things, so it is a great place to live in general."

Mostly college students, graduates and young couples. A large number of young families are observed in the area today. It is a vibrant ever changing neighborhood with new businesses opening every few months. It has everything a neighborhood needs. I do see housing and rent skyrocketing in the near future as real estate owners renovate to attract more young people. This has already begun."
Ditmars Steinway_cb9b3eff-13d6-4925-b6eb-423bff76b11a,"I love this area as a community, the parks are very local and the scenery is amazing.

Ditmars Steinway_ba7b5e9c-f739-4531-8526-278f2a3a21dc,"Astoria is a great place to live in. It is a residential neighborhood and it's safety at anytime of the day. The park is a great place to exercise or to have a picnic in family. It also has many amenities like the pool and the sports spaces. Also, Astoria is recognized by its diversity of restaurants and places to go out at night and have fun. It has everything I need. And, last but not least the transportation. This is the best thing Astoria have. The N and Q train are just 15-20 minutes away from the city. It is close to everything."

Ditmars Steinway_f2b52840-1b40-42c9-b630-19074123928f,"The housing is very suitable, but small. Compared to the city, the housing is cheaper, but still expensive because it is still in NYC. Price of rent is going up, but it has a high quality of life."
Ditmars Steinway_f2ca4d7e-3cb4-4193-84dc-11ad52f27d74,"People are very nice, but people there are new people moving into the area all the time, it the sense of community is not that strong."
Ditmars Steinway_8162e897-37fa-4181-8f57-e72491661f66,"For the most part, it is pretty safe. There are still some areas that have a higher crime rate than others."
Ditmars Steinway_ef640664-1c90-496e-82ce-d6229e161c06,"It is a very residential area and very close to the city. I would live here again in a heartbeat. Many new restaurants are opening up. There is much to do in this neighborhood, so it is better than going into Manhattan."
Ditmars Steinway_26c26fb6-a698-4147-b920-38957cbe6a96,"Growing up & living in the city has exposed me to many different cultures and new things. The people in my neighborhood are mostly friendly and my family knows a few of them. The city has a lot of different things to do and places to eat but everything is expensive, especially for families living here. Right now, a lot of people from different states and places are moving in and things are getting more and more expensive because of that. I think prices for everything will continue to rise and it'll be harder for long time residents to stay. I do love the place I live, I didn't choose to live here because this is just where I was born/grew up and where my parents did as well. If I'm able to, I plan on staying here after college as well. Public transportation is the best here, plus I have access to major train lines and buses from my neighborhood. I relied on public transport during high school because I went to school in a different borough so that's a definite plus."
Ditmars Steinway_528f94b2-0935-41b3-8adb-b681673eed97,"I have learned so much from moving into this area its like a dream come true. I have always wanted to liver here and I got the chance to and I am super happy I made that decision."

Ditmars Steinway_2f111961-e30b-4ec0-aca3-00854076c47e,"If I had to do it all over again I would definitely live in Astoria.

One major impact a recent severe storms had on my family was Hurricane Sandy.  It left us with out power for over 12 days.  The loss of food had a huge impact, however the major concern was for my parents.  My father uses a CPAP machine to sleep due to a medical condition he has from his work at Ground Zero during and after Sept 11, 2001 terror attacks.  This machine is used to help him breath while sleeping and requires electricity.  Twelve days without power was major health concern.  Secondly my mother is an amputee and uses a prosthesis to walk, also requiring daily electricity to charge.  Lastly my mother also has multiple sclerosis and requires an electric scooter for outside mobility.  Winter blizzards are always an issue in my area, closing roads, delayed or the shut down of mass transit 

seems to be an major issues the past few winters.  I have learned to be dressed in layers and carry extra food with me during my commute to be safe."

at home.  The prices are higher than neighboring town supermarkets and the store is not kept organized."
Downtown Brooklyn_9adaac92-07fa-48c8-a708-c7c2ee40363d,"THE view from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, a five-block walkway that has overlooked New York Harbor from its perch at neighborhood’s edge since 1950, is almost the same as it was 60 years ago. The Lower Manhattan skyline rises up, seeming close enough to touch, against a backdrop of cloudsYou come across the Brooklyn Bridge and suddenly to your right there’s this green lawn,” said Lisa Detwiler, a senior associate at the Corcoran Group and a longtime resident. “For all of us who live in Brooklyn Heights, it’s really exciting because we’ve all been hearing about it for the last 10 years.”

Before moving to a prewar co-op building at the corner of Hicks and Montague Streets in August, Ian Primrose and his partner, David Ly, lived on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, where brunch options were close but sleep could be difficult.

Downtown Brooklyn_90ec302d-6a0e-45ff-bdf9-06c95f9332f3,"I love Brooklyn. It is diverse. It is close to Manhattan. We have all the local trains here, such as the B and the Q which are express. Barclays center is just a small walk away. I feel apart of a community even though I am living in New York City. Downtown Brooklyn is beautiful, it has parks such as fort Green. A lot of stores are here and you can walk to the water as well."

DUMBO_cf674921-9ccd-4a04-a257-82c6556ef442,"Dumbo has a beautiful industrial feel to and has beautiful views of Manhattan and has a ton of galleys to check it.

Stop but get a pizza from Gremmaldies or love & dough and split it between loved ones in dumbo park and enjoy the brash from the hustle and bustle of The City."
DUMBO_1db40d8a-2cf4-4cef-a3f3-819150626d6c,"I love the vibe here. The rocks by the water is one of my favorite spots in the city! The buildings all look very charming but have new aesthetic as well. "

Coincidentally, all the friends I have made throughout the years of my life live within a 10 block radius of me which is pretty great. Everything you can possibly need is within walking distance and public transportation to any side of the city is available just a few blocks away. If I could go back and choose anywhere else to live, I would still chose this house. It is perfect and I wouldn't do anything differently."

Dyker Heights_7d575672-7b95-4ba2-b3a3-38bd20edc9f4,"There are always part-time jobs around in the local stores. Many stores have changed every few years so there are always room for people to start their own business, but unluckily, some might do better than others."

We are near the airport and the neighborhood has had famous people live here like Celia Cruz, Tommie Agee, and Louis Armstrong to name a few. I have lived here all my life and this area is so family friendly, my cousins live down the street. In the summer you see people fishing at the Bay and see people walking from the hotels to Citifield. When the US Open comes to town still another group of people casually walk by seeing the older homes, mansions from another time. I is a beautiful, classic , and classy neighborhood"
East Elmhurst_31c810c6-9be6-4a71-85ac-01cecf95d37b,"Certain parts of East Elmhurst is a quiet neighborhood. There is no loud traffic. The neighbors are generally polite with each other. I believe the great part about my neighborhood is there is always parking available. However, the city recently placed a bike line in my neighborhood, which  it is a dumb idea because there is no space. I do not like how the city is trying to make the other boroughs like Manhattan."

East Flatbush_717cf5e5-8979-40da-8259-13a5f465c611,"Safety has never been a major concern for me in this area of Brooklyn. Like I said before in my previous response, I may be slightly biased to this response considering that I have lived in the same area all of my life, but taking into consideration how I remember Flatbush being in the late 90's, I believe that the safety levels has increased dramatically over the last 15- 20 years.  Crime isn't readily apparent or persuasive in this area; maybe petty thefts, but it isn't something that is visible if one is walking down the street. I don't feel endangered living in this area so I rated my response as okay since I know that there are places that have higher and as well as lower levels of safety."
East Flatbush_a3c26707-4d9f-4555-848b-3c595c699eee,"I grew up in this area all of my life; therefore, my review will be slightly biased. Generally, I like the environment where I live---although the K-12 educational school system present in my area could be better, I think that there have been many improvements over time that have largely influenced the level of diversity that is becoming apparent in my area. Church Avenue, for example, has a theatre where celebrities come to perform; new clothing stores such as Gap have begun to appear around the area; and many gyms such as Planet Fitness and Retro Fitness have domesticated themselves in the area, giving the impression that the area is developing itself into somewhat of a new metropolitian section of Brooklyn."
East Flatbush_f3746e36-2a99-4702-8df5-203d6489ff89,"It's a decent neighborhood, but could use a lot of improvement--especially regarding safety.I have reservations about walking around here after dark. There are a lot of stores which are convenient to have around, but overall, this isn't somewhere where I'd like to stay."
East Flatbush_094cd814-9212-4555-901c-f2f0d8f1c020,"There are several methods of transportation in this area. I can't say much for the local government because there has been no interaction between the neighborhood and them as far as I know. The crime rates have steadily gone down thanks to a police watch that was implemented about a year ago. I'd like to believe that gang activity has gone down as well. The area is just a bit more save than it was when we moved in 4 years ago. I believe my neighborhood is improving for the better."

East Flatbush_d8d94959-3ae3-4a57-bfc1-136d89acac7b,"I love the neighborhood I live in however, gentrification is running us natives right out of Flatbush. The price of everything from rent to food is increasing by the minute, it seems like. The small businesses are struggling and closing left and right and it's saddening. Brooklyn, NY is currently the most expensive city in the country and while a quick and easy remedy would be to 'just move' it is not that simple, and honestly it will not fox the problem. It is not fair for landlords to hike up the rent for anyone just because there are people around who would pay a more expensive rent without a second thought. New York City generally has a reputation for being a pricey place to live in, but to me, it seems like there is a fine line between greed and compassion. We all have to live, right?"

Before this building was mostly for older folks. These young people are rude, dirty and loud. But they are not dangerous. Unlike other areas where I use to live."

This neighborhood might not be like a dream place or a play castle but this area has taught me many things in life. Too take everything for granted because one does not know when it will be the last time seen. This area has its pros and cons but considering the people moving into the area and the schools developing I see that the area will get better than what it is; with better stores and employments more affordable housing for those who need it."

Abandoned buildings here don't even get rebuilt, they just sit there with no one making an effort here.

There's a lot of crime in the area most of the time it's over some arguments that have been taken too far from a couple of just a drunk person bothering the wrong crowd. If you aren't from here or don't fit in it's best not to talk to anyone in the area since the wrong crowd always gets arrested here. Drugs are a main concern to the police here but they never make an effort to even try to stop it let alone suppress it."

There is also some cigar stores around here too since most people in this area love to smoke. The only popular stores around here are the fast food restaurants, electronic stores and the giant mall on 117st and Pleasant ave that attracts the most people anyway."
East Harlem_e8d71e19-cc76-464f-8006-9d118d1ca66e,"It depends on if you walk a little bit uptown or a little bit downtown.  A few blocks downtown, you begin to see all the bars, diners, and diverse restaurants that are a bit more pricey. A few blocks uptown and you begin to see Hispanic restaurants and the occasional street vendor that are more affordable."

East Harlem_074f8994-544e-4826-a416-57cb1be68976,"They're not the best, but the perk is that they generally tend to be cheaper. The Hispanic restaurants serve pretty good food at reasonable prices.  There are average grocery stores, but they're more affordable."

East Harlem_06b31360-1a79-4b95-babe-ce76d18a624f,"In the Upper East Side, it seems almost impossible to get away with anything, which is great. There are usually cops at every crosswalk along with marked cars and other officers in the area. Every once in a while, you do hear a passing siren,but nothing has happened so far in the area."
East Harlem_b258cd85-ea4e-4156-be29-04146f370d3c,"In the summer, although it is nice to be in New York City when it happens can be slightly unbearable. With the humidity and the heat creating a vortex of sweat, smeared make up, and possible ruined dresses while waiting for the subway, it makes you want to stay inside with the air conditioner blowing on the highest setting. However, once fall sets in the colors around Central Park and the rest of the area are made to make all of your instagram followers jealous. The sweltering heat calms down and settles into a nice breeze that is perfect for walks around the city. Once winter hits, the wind becomes normally cold, but as long as you bundle up with a scarf, hat, and gloves you survive the long winter months. My favorite season is definitely spring here! The weather is ideal and it brings a sense of comfort with sundresses, sandals and Rita's ice."

We do have several parks and recreational centers with fields, playgrounds and tracks which are all good in terms of size for the general public. Several events to promote good health are also things that may occur in our parks as well as free concerts supporting a good cause. However there's several cons with the parks. Maintenance seems to be a very poor throughout the parks in my area as well as polluted pounds and several homeless people use it as place to reside. Most times children encounter bad experience due to the people surrounding the parks around the city."
East Morrisania_9dcce6ba-3931-46fe-8bf1-03444fc5ea66,"From my time living in the Bronx crime has relatively slowed down. Its not extinct but the city has made major improvements in our safety. Even with the crime around the area people do feel safe because its a small geographical area, which causes  everyone to know each other and we have adapted to the crimes in our area. Police are visible throughout the city but really have a hard time being on time if a crime was to occur. Police interactions with civilians are also common and seems to cause a big issue with the general public. Overall it continues to improve but at the same time still has its defects and flaws."

We would have really hot summers with consistent heat waves causing several medical issues. Spring causes a lot of allergic reactions with the high humidity and the vast amount of pollen that the city brings which can harm people with asthma or breathing disabilities . The winter has to be the toughest season of them all due to low temperatures  and severe Winter snow storms. It causes us a hard commute to our jobs, several medical issue and creates several pot holes throughout the city causing accident rates through the roof."

Due to the high unemployment rates in my area landing a job becomes equivalent to winning the lottery and it gets very competitive when a position becomes available nearby."
East Morrisania_b094c1f9-dffa-44e2-97b0-0385cdf83699,"In terms of food and drinks around my neighborhood there are several restaurants that can provide us with good quality meals. Nightlife and clubs are not relatively close, it does consist a 10 to 15 minute commute but due to public transportation in the New York City area this becomes an extremely easy task. Favorite dishes around my area would be the Italian pasta from a nearby Italian restaurant located just 3 minutes away from my neighborhood. Great in quantity and has awesome taste of natural flavors."

East Morrisania_7f37837e-b6d2-4a72-87e6-af2b8d188a86,"There is a variety of cultures and markets based on culture. There is the train station close by and a lot of stores (supermarkets, pharmacies, deli-stores, barber shops, hair salon, library, etc...) and there are buses that can take you to other train stations areas and to the mall and movies. It is a safe environment in the afternoon and empty at night but not that scary some stores open until 12 pm. There are lots of parks around my neighborhood."
East New York_4f40f6e4-3fef-4d79-9ce3-eee32fbed2e5,"I moved to New York from another country and it was total culture shock. There was barely any place for children to express themselves outside.  As time progressed, I adapted.  But moving here wasn't all that bad. I learned how to survive in the city. I've learned that even though the city can be quite noisy, my neighborhood can still provide peace and tranquility. Even though there were drug dealers along my route to school they understood their job was to protect and not to harm us. Now I feel as though it is no longer a kid or family friendly neighborhood. Every night, before I go to bed I can count the number of sirens.  They have placed a few displaced centers as well as mental care facilities within the neighborhood. You can guarantee they will be either walking down your street idly looking into your homes."
East New York_5fd8e8a9-c03f-4280-bfdf-36c824eb954f,"With the inclusion of the homeless shelters which were approved by the previous mayor, we now have an element of community disapproval. The individuals within the shelter can be seen on a daily basis roaming the streets which was not the environment we had previously.  Everything that has happened since we started living here isn't always negative, we do have a positive attitude towards community awareness as well as an increase in the number of individuals willing to live within our community limits. With the inclusion of the middle and working class, East New York has fewer abandoned buildings and more recently renovated living and commercial spaces.  We can attribute these changes to the new inclusion of the mall, located within walking distance. This new commercial space has provided, access to more jobs, shopping and wellness incentives. We are proud to call this area within our borough, our home."

It is still there, just not as frequent. "

In the summer its way too hot for my liking. Like 2 summers ago there was a heat wave here and it was unbearably hot so the heat isn't great. The winter snow really isn't a joke, when it snows theres always a few huge piles of snow on like every corner. We have hurricanes sometimes that knockout the internet. there was an earthquake somewhere before and we had a very minor aftershock you barely felt it, so I am grateful for that. so the weather here isn't great but its bearable."

There are many downsides to the East Village: for example, the presence of popular destinations such as Union Square and St. Mark's means that the area is often populated. This is not the neighborhood for someone who wishes to get off the subway and walk down quiet streets to his or her home. However, the atmosphere is always vibrant and artistic. There are many wonderful hidden gems in this neighborhood, especially a little further east (1st Ave and on) that doesn't garner as much tourism. The neighborhood has a wonderful sense of diversity. In terms of transportation, living in close proximity to Union Square offered convenient access to the green and yellow lines, as well as the L train. Additionally, there are multiple bus lines that stop in the area."

It's easy to feel lonely. No stranger is going to stop and talk to you because everyone is busy and on the way to something. It's also not much of a place where people settle down or have kids; it's a lot of independent people who are ambitious with their work and interests. There are lots of events to go to, but they're more touristy and not relevant to the 'community.'"

There are peaceful places to go, like Central Park or Brighton Beach; there are inspiring places to go, like the cultural hub that is Washington Square Park; and there are so many museums where you can learn new things and appreciate art and culture from all over the world. New York City is a very liberal, accepting place, and I feel like I fit in here with people who are fighting for justice and equality. I love my decision to move here. New York City is one of the greatest places in the world, and it has so much to offer--beautiful sights, unique experiences, a melting pot of cultures, art, theater, music, and more.

There is a drug store, pharmacy, and plenty of bars for night life. There aren't a lot of chains, the only one, which is new, is a 7/11/. I never go there, and alot of the community avoids it as well because it closed a mom and pop shop. There are also local gardens who compost which is cool. There are a bunch of vintage and thrift stores, some are better than others. I just hope not too many people try to move here because then stuff will get even more expensive.

Name a country and you will likely find their native cuisine a few blocks away. Want to go to an upscale bar, not a problem. How about a sports bar or laid back bar with friends?

From the cupcake store next to the ice cream store, the new Italian restaurant around the corner from the Thai restaurant, and the homemade bagels down the block, food is at a premium. There is an amazing family owned drug store a five minute walk away with all your daily sick needs and a pharmacist to help. For the prescriptions, CVS pharmacy, Duane Reed and Walgreens are a seven minute walk away in the opposite direction. Instead of chain clothing stores, an abundance of small thrift stops are littered around every corner, a college student's dream. However, the best part of all is the abundance of mom-and-pop coffee spots hidden around corners and tucked in the middle of avenues. Starbucks will never suffice again."

The cost of living can prove quite costly if you are buying and not renting. In my opinion I would consider the cost of renting to be above market rate unless you live in Public Housing. Most of the apartments for rent do not include utilities or electricity. The best thing about living in New York is that the water is free if you are a renter.

Edgemere_d8c4220f-f585-4ae9-95f0-d02f7436742d,"Compared to how Far Rockaway used to be a couple of years back, I believe crime has decreased in the area and safety has increased. There's the usual crime that happens daily but looking at the bigger picture, I believe the area is getting nicer in terms of people and safety."
Edgemere_702f1c3f-520c-4aa7-9cf4-37d4ace2e3a3,"The area is nice and quiet but there aren't that many relevant stores around. Also the beach smell could get quite annoying as well as it being noticeably colder once you're in the actual area. Despite those things, everything else about living in Far Rockaway is nice. The people are friendly and it's very spacious and not too busy."

Elmhurst_d0766a37-193d-460d-bdee-7caa97a36a71,"Elmhurst is a place full of diversity. It is a place where you can find food from around the world. It's like a little world in a single town."
Elmhurst_ff399d62-9c10-451a-8205-a0da77b65008,"I live in a working class neighborhood and is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Queens, NY.I have lived in Elmhurst for 23 years (all my life), and I have seen tremendous development in my community. We have all nearest groceries and shopping center as well as a nearby gym and recreational centers for the youth. Recently, they have reconstructed a new library in which all Elmhurst citizens can gain access to."
Elmhurst_a81a2d1b-25b8-4ccd-b60d-7d9dc9cb8683,"Great place to live in, well in some parts. Mostly quiet. There is a large diversity of ethnicities. You can easily commute anywhere  by taking a train and or a bus. There are a lot of stores where you can easily buy anything right around the corner from where ever you live. The houses are really expensive thou, compared to Long Island or any other state."
Elmhurst_3e69f323-5dea-46c1-8732-a42373d1b4e2,"Elmhurst is very diverse, and the local stores, restaurants, and supermarkets offer conveniences that connect everyone to their home countries. Most people here are respectful, but some are ignorant and biased. There is a large number of homeless people in this area."
Elmhurst_3ebad0a5-138c-47c8-8e6e-f619bf4b65eb,"Elmhurst and its neighboring town of Jackson heights is home to the most diverse population in the world. The businesses also reflect this cultural diversity and with so much around it is extremely convenient. There have been much development such as the public library and public parks that make this place more family friendly. Perhaps the main areas that I would like to see some change is the crowdedness and more precaution with safety."
Elmhurst_65d5b832-5a6d-4039-8da6-19271fe2d062,"This is a Nice and safe neighborhood. Very family friendly and convenient.  It is a very friendly neighborhood and easy to transport to different destinations."
Elmhurst_9f29541f-7b63-4907-b5be-9fbd227f5cbd,"Elmhurst, NY is one of the many neighborhoods in NYC that perfectly represents the famous slogan of NYC, the'melting pot' or more currently, the 'salad bowl'! This is because Elmhurst is so diversified and rich in so many different cultures and ethnicity groups. I grew up interacting with Chinese, Indians, Jews, Hispanics, African-Americans and Muslims. It's a wonderful place to live in because you don't have to travel far to find any authentic cuisine. Whether it's Vietnamese sandwiches to Mexican tacos, Elmhurst has it all. I love this neighborhood because, despite the fact that there are so many different kinds of people here, every culture retains their uniqueness while respecting each other's differences."
Elmhurst_dbef07ed-4594-4219-8a35-1f3cf5dedf6f,"it's a very beautiful area with a lot of diversity. there are different kind of restaurants to go eat diverse plates. the parks are also very nice. it's a very cozy place"

Elmhurst_c501cfb1-246d-46da-81fd-bdc75f7dd4f9,"Born and raised in Elmhurst. Made me the man I am today, but I'm glad I was able to leave as soon as I did. No place to raise a family. More of a temporary fix or a recent grad due to the short commutes to Manhattan and cheap rent."
Elmhurst_05eec8d5-8461-4e61-8d55-bd132d8a70c6,"It's a pretty good place to live. Mostly peaceful, a tad boring, there are things to do around. For starters, there are two large malls containing everything you could possible want (unless its really specific) plus lots of side shops with cheap prices and traditional food places that give pretty good food if you ask me. There are a few parks nearby, and tho they are not big, they are pretty good. They even have parks with grass since most of the parks in New York has concrete flooring so it a pretty rare treasure we got in Elmhurst."
Elmhurst_732bf51b-db6e-4d13-89ae-9a8c03c27192,"What I like about Elmhurst is that it is full of many different people with different cultures and background. Near the Elmhurst, Broadway Park, there are a lot of Asian restaurants near such as: Pho Bac, Khao Kang, Ayada Thai, and Boon Chu. My most favorite place is Boon Chu because their food is great, the owners are friendly, and its fast serving. In addition, it is surrounding by many enjoyable fast food/take out places. One for example is Quicklys, Panda Cafe, Dunkin Donuts, etc... Since the coming of 'PokemonGo,' the nightlife here has been wild. Many people are coming out of their houses catching pokemon late at night. Many of the hotpots are on 76st, Broadway Park, Starbucks near the Queens Blvd. In all, Elmhurst is an amazing place. Its a great community and there are ways to get things ;) . "
Elmhurst_c59b7c6a-a9e5-4590-87db-eb5322be489e,"It is really a great experience to live in this neighborhood, with plenty of diversity seen around. It is a clean place to be living at. "
Elmhurst_fba9f4c4-d0b4-4e0f-85a7-4b2d561c8d01,"we have been having a lot of issues in regards to homeless shelters being placed in our community it has brought the neighborhood to ruins and everyone seems so unhappy between the protests i feel our mayor has just turned our city into ruins."
Elmhurst_605126ef-a36a-4b48-8613-c08ffe2f08dc,"Living in western Queens sure is something! The streets are packed during the day and busy during the night as well. There is always something going on whether it's Zumba in the local park or a bike race that shuts down an entire 40 blocks of city streets. When it comes to shopping there are plenty of stores to spend your hard earned dollars on.The local mall is huge and the sales there are excellent. Everything is in walking distance, that is if you love to walk, however the reliable transportation makes it even more convenient to get around. I do feel safe walking in the day time as well as during the night time. Although there are people walking at all hours of the day, I do not recommend walking alone past 2 am, especially not in isolated unlit areas. Overall though, Elmhurst is a lovely place to live if you like people and are easily bored!"
Elmhurst_003ede58-2dc2-4c71-8741-0a2d2230df9b,"I know of family members who have been victims of crime while walking home late at night in the neighborhood, however, in recent years, I have not heard of such incidences. Police members are visible near the mall, but not with much prevalence in other areas. A cop car will occasionally drive through, but it is far from being very monitored."
Elmhurst_da73b01d-1d39-485c-a158-5c211213fc57,"It is a relatively safe neighborhood with easy access to resources such as day camps, post offices, hospitals, stores, etc. There is a public recreation center, a mall, playgrounds, etc., and the general atmosphere is quite friendly. I would live here again, as I enjoy the diversity and the middle ground between living in the busy city and suburbia. It is a quick 15 minute train ride into the city, and driving places is also rather convenient."
Elmhurst_9e8bf78b-4739-43b4-8ae9-9d1b3941bdba,"there is no to very minimal crime in this area. Most of the time there are police and other figures of authority around the neighborhood patrolling. The population is primarily families and younger children, many schools are in the area."

Elmhurst_ebd1033f-47d6-45f1-8007-15b04475bb1a,"I live in a metropolitan area, where there are highways, supermarkets, shopping malls, and everything anyone could possibly need just a few steps away. Compared to anywhere else in New York, I would say Queens is relatively a cool place to live because everything is usually a reasonable price. However, Manhattan and other boroughs are usually expensive."
Elmhurst_4d49bf41-eafd-4369-bd49-33ed12454032,"Not by my house per say but the area in general is definitely getting more dangerous overall."

Elmhurst_60a7aec8-2987-47ac-9968-81df03371ca2,"since I move to Elmhust i liked this area because of it variety. I could find easily every thing I need, my school, restaurants, supermarket, bakeries, gloceries, even the fire-station is close from my home, and the police station was near my house"

Elmhurst_3ad01aa5-1336-440a-8592-8c355a59dd63,"Rent in New York is really high, my area in Queens is pretty close to Manhattan hence the rent is higher than those farther from the city. I think it is still proportionate, when distance and accessibility is taken into consideration. There are no abanboned buildings or vacant lots as far as I know. I think people who live here have lived here awhile, turnover of renters is not that high. This location is pretty much one of my favorites in the borough because of the convenience and the neighborhood."
Elmhurst_cb898764-5f63-4632-ba16-a766589d7c3c,"People here are very peaceful and consciencious. Even during parties, there are no improper noises or sounds. Not all will greet each other, maybe because of their culture which are mostly Asians, but they will lend a hand if needed. My only concern is for pet owners who do not clean up after their pets, and the sidewalks can be disgusting at times."
Elmhurst_9278dcad-b832-430e-8dd1-dcfc3abcae66,"So far I feel safe in thus area. There are regular police presence in the main road (Queens blvd.). Lighting is not a problem and people do not loiter in the streets."
Elmhurst_5a6d08ad-0872-490f-a2cd-15dc221bb852,"My address in Queens, New York I would describe as one of the nicest in the borough. It is a few stops to Manhattan via the subway, and the stations are a short walk from the apartment. If you have a car it is also easy to find parking along the streets. I feel safe in this area, whether I walk to the subway or take my car. Another nice thing about this area is that it is very diversed."
Elmhurst_661e553d-b808-45a2-992e-541deb6320db,"Sometimes there is a public disturbance at odd hours of the night, and every now and then there is a reported assault."
Elmhurst_57440dd5-5d4a-4224-86c6-b33b5e421498,"This area is okay because I spend most of my time at home. When I am outside I spend most of my time in Manhattan or Brooklyn."
Elmhurst_9f44908c-6c75-4857-9324-7f7d4ae34286,"Rarely any vacant or abandoned properties. Very nice looking houses."

Elmhurst_c4154d2f-bad1-435a-992c-5d0209e53e63,"Community is very friendly. I celebrate eid and during that time the community hosts multiple prayers which can be attended if you live around there"
Elmhurst_2b2a368c-7a9d-4e7a-b8dc-7b2a25c5f364,"Barely any crimes but since the hospital is very close by police tend to respond very quickly to situations"
Elmhurst_b1cfa69c-c5f1-444a-b484-ae8bf4fe3beb,"The environment is very quiet yet very close to all the necessary shops and transportation. You can basically get to anywhere in ny by taking one of the trains which are located one block away. It's a south asian community mostly so it feels very welcoming but there is also a lot of diversity within"
Elmhurst_8376237a-6009-4bfe-88ce-85d19666ecf8,"Its a good school but is easy to feel overwhelmed"
Elmhurst_54b2e65e-b7ae-4435-86fc-f9705330ed22,"I've been living in this area practically my whole life so i wouldn't be able to compare it to anywhere else. On an average day, it's a pretty tranquil place to live except for those rare moments where a policeman got shot or there are wanted posters on the street. Small businesses tend to not gain a lot and a few have closed already, including a supermarket. At night it can be dangerous, or at least for me since there's a club a few stores down where I live. However the police station and fire station are pretty close by. The fire station which I'm glad for because the fourth floor of my apartment caught on fire a few months ago. 

But, overall, it's an alright place to live. Although maintenance of it could use some help. For example, the ice doesn't get removed for a few days during the winter so you have to be careful when walking on our sidewalk."
Elmhurst_70f38456-772e-4702-bef6-0718d1d07b0f,"Ease of access to both sides of New York, east and west. Vast variation of public transportation helps commute easily thus allowing more variations to choose for employment locations."
Elmhurst_53c50abb-5e7f-4d48-b372-58c01960f89e,"I've been living here since junior high and it's been all right in terms of living. There's a diversity in ethnicity and races. Although it's not the type of neighborhood where we know each other or bother talking to each other (from what I've noticed)--so everyone keeps to themselves."

Elmhurst_899abdd7-0db1-425a-bf05-0f4e1afa4c6c,"In the area I live in, I barely see any abandoned properties or properties that were shut down. The cost of housing is rising every year or two as usual because of our economy and most houses are pretty old. The houses and buildings all have some ages already."
Elmhurst_91320bbe-fc3f-452c-859f-e3293399c831,"The overall environment in this area is good. Multiple parks for people from all age gap to choose from. There are also sections around the park for seniors to play board games and park made especially for young kids to play at. Even though this area doesn't really have multiple outdoor activities that is available, the quality of the parks here are just amazing. There might be a few number of people who litters in the park but people do clean them up in the end. Unfortunately wildlife and national parks are no where to be found in this area. However, we are grateful for what we've got here already."
Elmhurst_07048ffc-6bda-4336-ab7f-0ecff3e19806,"I can't give too much opinion on this because I haven't heard of crimes in this area. Although if there was one you'll never notice anyway because the people here aren't very gossipy and they don't talk about it. However if there was going to be one, I believe the police is going to try and arrive as soon as possible but there are no headquarters around this area so it'll take sometime for them to come. There is only fire department and hospital around here. Usually I don't see police patrol around Elmhurst but if there is going to be one, it's going to be around the edge of this area where it's pretty dark at night and where most of the crimes in this area happened at."
Elmhurst_d5acc6b5-3677-447a-b90e-2f275e03d823,"The weather here in this area is great. Sometime it could be very terrifying because of the blizzards and winter storms especially from 2014 to 2015. There was a lot of blizzard warning and they even closed down our public school during a day in regents week which amazed me."
Elmhurst_9e93f0e2-45e1-4656-8b24-5f0e11753c47,"I am not a picky kind of person but the food here is just, amazing. To me being able to eat from restaurant opened by people all over the world is probably the best thing that can ever happen. My mother always told me that when I die, I'll have to die full. I have to try out every kind of food in this world and right now i'm living my food life."
Elmhurst_c0f509f4-95e2-463d-897c-5a6b1d7b6672,"Although there a lots of stores and shops around here, but it's definitely not the place that people dream to work at. This isn't a very popular neighbor hood and most people around here are immigrants including myself and my family. Individuals sometime can't choose its path and their destiny, a lot of them had no choice other than to work in the restaurants in this area for minimum wage. This isn't an area like Manhattan where it's very crowded and has a lot of skyscrapers, it's an area where people just came here to work for minimum wage because they couldn't find job anywhere else."
Elmhurst_ae9479ef-5e42-4afc-b48b-55e27b66e91e,"Overall, the local businesses in Elmhurst is great. Ever since I started living here, I never worried about anything in particular, maybe just open fields. There are plenty of restaurants in this area from every country and cheap huge supermarkets down the block too. It was never a problem going to places whether uptown or downtown because there are quite a few number of trains and buses around here. The best thing here is the mall,the Queens Center Mall which is very famous here in New York. It's where I go with my friends every now and then to shop and eat in the food court while enjoying our fast food orders."

Elmhurst_4eea5255-1049-45c1-b004-bc7ffbcc9afd,"The Thai food in Elmhurst is good! Authentic and average cost. Aside from Thai/Malaysian food there is not much variety here. The bars are full of creepy people who beg you to buy them drinks. Not fun!"
Elmhurst_ec10d615-7f67-4d72-903d-f3f32d52d3f0,"I am rating the grocery stores and their food selection. I live in Elmhurst, very close to Jackson Heights where a new organic store just opened up which I like. However, I would still have to walk to another town to get my groceries there and it is expensive. Other than that in my direct area we have a Food Town and an Asian Market. It is extremely difficult to find good quality food here."

I think that this is great and gives a feel of authenticity to the neighborhood. Elmhurst can be called the model neighborhood for what NYC really represents."

Even though I barely ate out, if I did need to eat out with friends or family - there were many options. In Elmhurst there are many kinds of shops - mainly small privately owned stores. There were a few chain stores like TenRen's bubble tea and Quickly's bubble tea shop, Walgreens, Target, but there's many more small shops than big businesses.

I do not see much pets, and there are not many events that might bring people together. The different races make it a little hard for families to blend. People tend to get together with people who come from the same country as they are."
Elmhurst_fb00490e-cfcb-470e-bdef-a2ec84b3e7b7,"I can say that this area is pretty safe. Crime is almost unheard of. I feel pretty safe walking from the train station to my apartment building after 9 pm by myself. I wish there are more lights though."

Most of them are quite good. Queens Mall is close, so you can get those food court foods: McDonald, KFC, Sbarro. Do not come to the area for the nightlife though. It is just a one quiet neighborhood after 10 pm."
Elmhurst_435ac9be-f442-486a-a67a-63cab1cc1846,"People from so many races live together here, especially from Asia and Southeast Asia. You will hear people talk in different languages around you.

But many things are within walking distance, like stores, parks, and libraries. The buses are never on time, but there are many of them to get you to wherever you need.

I have seen rockaway become a place where you want to raise your kids. Crimes have decrease dramatically! And gang violence have sub seized. A diverse community began to develop. Especially after Hurricane Sandy, we took a hard hit and rose together to overcome obstacles. After the hurricane, our broad walk, train stations, etc where repaired and remodel to release Rockaway true beauty. YMCA, Stop and Shop, 'Arverne by the Sea' attractions (Thai Food, Checkers, Pizza shop, Nail Salon, etc.) makes the Rockaway a very convenient place. I love Far Rockaway, we have an even brighter future ahead of us."

For one thing, I can say about living in Far Rockaway, NY is its beautiful living next to the beach. Some of the bad things are since we are by the water in the winter time it's extra cold and there is nothing to really do out here people either have to travel to Brooklyn, NY or Manhattan, NY to have some kind of fun. And since hurricane sandy, it really messed up Far Rockaway some things are still rebuilding.

By living in Far Rockaway I learned that racism exists because many people discriminate the minor group in the community. But from my personal experience, it is a quite town but dangerous at times. I say this because I know many people who have been victims of crimes such as robbery, assault, and burglary. Still, I like my town even though it is not a nice area to live without the fear of being robbed one time in their life, but I know a lot of people in the area and I think that they commit less crime with people that they see frequently."

There is some great food in this area with the mixing of cultures. Some things that have changed in the past few years  is some of the buildings and malls like the triangle junction and the new performing arts complex at Brooklyn College. Some improvements that still needs to be changed in this area is giving more working opportunities in the area and revitalizing small businesses that are struggling due to competition. Finally rent and the cost of living is a concern as prices are rising which is causing difficulties for residents."

As years past, the neighborhood crime rate decreased and gentrification has increased. What I love about Flatbush is that it is so diverse. Everywhere you go in this neighborhood, you will be able to meet people from all around the world. There is nothing I would change about Flatbush."

My grandmom lived here when my mom was young, so there's many stories about the changing over the years.  As of today, there are lots of delicious places to eat, hang out and shop just below Prospect Park. Some Highlights are Kings Theater for live music performances,  the Flatbush Food Coop, newly opened Greenlight Book Store with author events and book clubs, and so many restaurants!  My personal faves are Bay Leaf for Indian,  Zen Vegetarian for Chinese and Parkside for fancy pizza."
Flatbush_e87acf39-8806-44e8-ba11-dcaa25c1cc95,"I've been living in Flatbush forover 10years and I love it! One of the main things I love about it is the diversity. There are so many different cultures that bring great restaurants for your local food agent. The night life is awesome for adults,threes a few local bars and night clubs. When it is time to have family time,prospect park is the go to spot. You can ride pedal boats in the summer on the water or ride through the park on a bike car. Or when the weather gets a little colder you can enjoy ice skating. I would recommend Flatbush to any one seeking a new living experience. You have great schools within a great community...what more could you ask for."
Flatbush_04876622-b2d1-4186-aa53-c69f4fe7f3a6,"My neighborhood is an exquisite living area. There is a corner store on every other block as well as a supermarket. Public Transportation is everywhere including the Q, F, G and B train as well as B41, B35, B62, B103 and the B16. There are two well known parks; The Parade grounds and Prospect Park. Both parks contain a basketball court, track, horse riding, pool, ice skating ring, etc. This area is very diversed and it keeps the children very engaged in all of the activities. The living space is amazing."

Flatbush_dff50dab-0d5c-4fcb-b7d5-77c63854bb1f,"The crime in my area has increased over the past few years. What concerns me is the lack of moral and general concern for the working person and their lives. The police aren't concerned with the matters of the neighborhood as they are with being comfortable within this community. I am not afraid of this territory because it is not a bad place to live. However, the police need to focus on what matters or even being around instead of watching and serving no purpose."
Flatbush_195f07f7-6eba-4d47-bc30-afc18c9edef1,"Due to my circumstances, I moved into this area in a hurry. However, if I had to rethink the decision, I would have moved into the general area, just not in this particular building. This is an up an coming area, every week, I see new developments within a 5 mile radius, which allows more opportunities for business owners and job seekers.

My neighborhood is quite diverse and caters to the vast majority of people within this territory, which is found throughout the country, but no other city can be compared to New York City. However, there are many areas in which you will find the same form of advancement and there is nothing wrong with that. The community has to evolve in order to keep up with the pace, or unfortunately be left being the subject of high rental increases."

I plan on keeping this house in the family and raising my kids in this neighborhood. I've lived here my whole life and have seen the surrounding areas progression. There are more restaurants and store opening up on the two main streets and I assume they will continue to do so. The location is also very convenient since we are right by prospect park and the subway, which is only a 30 min ride into Manhattan."

The surrounding stores and restaurants provide me with everything I need, this neighborhood is not a food dessert. I have two farmers markets within walking distance of my home. There are tons of West Indian food spots so I love eating out. There are three libraries within walking distance and three public schools. So there is a lot around so living here is very convenient. I feel very safe travelling at night and I have as late as 4 a.m. My neighbors are great so nice that they will let me stay in there in homes when I was locked out of mine.

In addition to that there are several of the same businesses on different streets and sometimes even on the same block. There are no shortage of any kind of service. If you aren't satisfied with big chain companies and their services, mom and pops stores are present but a bit more costly. The local bodegas or mini grocery stores are plenty (sometimes too plenty) and convenient. Depending on who you are or what you look like the service may not be too consumer friendly.

For jobs which are mainly minimum wage jobs with little to no benefits are somewhat plenty. The fast food chains, clothing department/retail, grocery stores and other similar places are available for those needing only jobs. As for careers, where education is almost all the time a requisite, on the other hand is sparse depending on the career of course. Healthcare for example states that there is a shortage of nurses within in the entire nurses however as more institutions are looking for baccalaureate qualified candidates for hire, the pool of candidates ready to work dwindles. Other careers like law enforcement aren't too demanding to get in. But on the other side of the coin, unemployment is pretty prevalent in this area."

Its cleaner, the facades of high rise apartment buildings have been revamped including the interior. With that being said long time residents that dwelled in the community for such a long time are beginning to move elsewhere so that landlords can welcome in the new faces and a new fat wallet."

Even though there may be days where police present is not seen there are surveillance cameras mounted high on light poles, whether they are actively operating is another matter. To say that these cameras are to deter criminals does not seem to me at least to produce such intended affect for there is still ongoing criminal activity that take place almost on a regular basis."

Over the ten years I've lived here, there were a few accidents between Ave L and East 37th street because there was no light. However, to ensure that it doesn't happen again, a traffic light was placed at the intersection in replacement of a stop sign. The elementary school, P.S 119, on Avenue K has continued to improve its school. It created a playground and expanded the building to hold and accept more students. I enjoy living here. I live right next to my church, Starbucks is around the corner, and there's a park on Avenue M my friends and I love to go to. If I could rewind time, I wish I was born here.

When I walk down the street,  I feel safe knowing that there are police officers standing at street corners and sitting in vehicles to make sure that the streets are safe.  From time to time you may see altercations on busy street corners such as Flatbush Junction, but police are always present or not too far away to respond quickly. I havent been outside past 12am to know what crime is like around that time, but when I am asleep I do hear helicopters and police cars from time to time.

The area that I live in is jewish based,  so you will get knocks on your door asking for a purchasing price on your home.  That is good news considering that the properties are rising in value. I would choose to live here again because of the convenience of transportation,  grocery stores and restaurants.  I believe that this area will grow in popularity as new businesses move to brooklyn and more stores thay are usually found in manhattan will also be available in brooklyn as well.

Flatlands_0e8a36dc-33f7-4fd8-90e6-28357b00b3ae,"There are a few workout facilities, many people prefer to stay active by running or riding bikes. Health care is convenient and good quality. Most people seem healthy and are healthy weights in this area."

The cost is a little much, but not ridiculous for this time."
Flatlands_2ca5db2e-0ded-4b7a-93a5-9ad614401b86,"This neighborhood is not the safest, but it could definitely be much worse. There are a few crimes every once in a while, but if you keep to yourself mostly and do not pay attention to those you may see hanging around on the corners or get yourself into trouble, you will be fine. Police can be seen driving through the area, and I have actually seen that someone has be stopped for something before, but they usually do't hang around for too long in the neighborhood."

We don't get anything too extreme; the only abnormal thing we might get is an extreme deviation in temperature from the average: for example, right now we are about 20 degrees below our average temperature for this time of year. Flooding can be a problem, but it does not occur often -- the rain has to be an unusually large amount."
Flatlands_2d79fac7-7026-4e24-91ea-e8185ddc1571,"Not much nightlife around, at least that I know of. The restaurants nearby are mostly caribbean restaurants around here that sell similar foods. There aren't any fancy restaurants or anything like that, but plenty of pizza and fried chicken places, as well as fast food. If you are hungry, you can find something to eat, it just might not be anything different or special."

The problem is, they would be jobs like working in the supermarket, or a fast food place, making minimum wage and not jobs to establish a career in."

There are places to get food as well, but nothing fancy. There are plenty of pharmacies around, and are all easy to reach. There aren't too many new businesses going up--there are a lot of the same businesses that have been here since I came to the neighborhood that are still here today."

Flatlands_4c884cbd-8d16-46e7-8997-e7cf004aa1b1,"All the houses basically look the same. Most are semi-attached and share a driveway. But each home has their own backyard with a shed. For now, it is a good quiet neighborhood to raise a family. A public elementary school and catholic school are within walking distance. Fairly attentive cross-guards occupy each block every weekday morning. There aren't many abandoned houses. Maybe one, if any, on each avenue, but they aren't atrocious to look at. However, there is one hoarder that everyone knows and makes it known that he likes to hoard. He even decorates his house with cheerios boxes. Other than that, neighborhood's pretty boring."

There is one mall that I almost never go to anymore and a few pharmacies and small shops in an outlet. Otherwise, most people head to the city for everything else."

In different parts of Flushing, there are concentrations of different Asian ethnicity; toward Northern Boulevard, there are more Korean residents and toward Kissena Boulevard, there are more Indian residents. Commuting to and from Flushing is also very convenient. There are numerous buses going through different neighborhoods, and airports. The 7 train runs directly to Manhattan's 34th St and Times Square. There are a few school districts in Flushing, however the quality is lackluster. The schools in nearby neighborhoods have better opportunity for student growth."

I say this because, as an Asian American, I am in love with my hometown. This place has brought wonders upon my life and is not only a friendly place overall, but is also reasonably priced. It is important to note however that many people around this area like to smoke on the streets; if there is one thing I'd like to change about this great town, it'd have to be the faces of anyone who smokes in a building or while walking on a crowded street."

Mainstreet is the heart of Flushing which  has a large Asian population (think of a mini China Town). You can get the best bubble tea and fried dumplings at New World Mall. Flushing is also the home to the Shea Statium. The best thing about living in Flushing is the diversity and culture.

Flushing_fd407cba-578a-4377-9b12-c70a4280b564,"Fresh meadows compared to the rest of NYC is really quiet which I really like. The area is quiet during the day, afternoon and night. Although it is far from the subway, it is still close to public transportation via bus. One of the best things about this area is Kissena Park and it's scenery. Overall, living in Fresh Meadows is really peaceful."
Flushing_9d84a8d5-f582-4cc4-a301-628120946746,"The atmosphere is very quiet and suburban. There are a lot of places to get food along Northern Blvd which is great for hanging out with my friends. The buses run frequently and the 7 train is very accessible. I would like to live at a different place, just because I've been living here for 10+ years now. The problem we have is that there are a lot of cockroaches at my apartment and they won't go away no matter what we do."

Flushing_2b7a2e39-e796-4126-9f5b-d6baa05f8078,"There has been plenty of crimes in this area; robberies, rapes, assaults. Not comfortable here. We have a precinct a few blocks away but that doesn't stop it."
Flushing_bef24bef-b1d4-49a1-9b8d-79810f0fdff4,"I grew up in this area and recently came back after more than 10 years. Much has changed, it seems dirtier and overcrowded. Lots of smokers around here and driving is the worst around here. Everything, as far as apartments and stores are upgrading, as more people with money are coming here due to the convenience of public transportation, which is important in New York. It is not far from Manhattan however I cannot wait to move away."

Most people stay for over 10 years if not their entire life"
Flushing_7f8d58f6-6e57-49e0-a1de-ea0f4b171262,"there have been several robberies and vandalisms in the neighborhood, the police mainly stay on the larger streets and avenues, however i have never had a problem and i feel safe where i live"
Flushing_08d335a2-3340-48a4-a2dc-2aa8e3adf5a5,"this place is located nearby 2 parks so there are a lot of things to do as well as space when growing up, there are a lot of local buses to go to many places of interest. its a relatively quiet neighborhood, and i would live here again given the chance to."

Flushing_e8b3dfd2-8384-41ef-a76b-3e969b6f8799,"I would live here again, but I feel like I would enjoy living somewhere else currently. Living close to a city has made me used to living around large buildings and a lot of people and this has added to my reluctance to move away. I would prefer living in the suburbs but all the driving would be inconvenient. In the future, I see this area staying relatively the same in regards to atmosphere and general quality of life."
Flushing_613dbb06-0774-4c97-8096-c1ddf813ef1b,"the area is pretty decent. its live able."

Flushing_d0ed0bcd-a80b-4b08-b29b-197707fae4b7,"I do love where I live; however, for my age I think that there are other places more 'hopping and bopping' and simply more attractive to live. But the price is great and the accessibility to the city and college campus is amazing. There is tons to do and lots of places to eat. I always feel safe which is so important. I do think that the libraries in Queens need a makeover, especially in the children's section. I nanny and it was definitely disappointing to see that there was not enough funding (I assume) to create a fun learning environment for children. Esprcially as a future educator. I would love to use the local libraries as a tool to teach."
Flushing_f94de046-0105-45a9-a35f-bd18bf71a86f,"Overall this area is great, for its vast diversity in both its residents and its attractions."
Flushing_cd347485-e388-44a7-ac02-4914dfd2b516,"I guess the resident here have a job but whether a job they desire or not is not in my knowledge."
Flushing_95cb07a5-4933-4139-92e8-6cc0ff8b28a1,"I rarely go to any of the stores in this area, only if I have to. Because I buy stuff on my way home from school."
Flushing_28f04599-7783-4770-8534-9284cf7e9f8c,"Most houses here were built around the same time I believe, in the 1930's. All of them follow the same layout except for those that have been newly built. There are not ANY abandoned houses and all the houses in the neighborhood appear presentable and well kept. The houses are very expensive, most range at a minimum of 600,000.  The best area would be closes to Fresh Meadows and farther from the Housing Project Pomonok."
Flushing_204b6afa-6c7c-49d1-8c66-7f529787baae,"This area in particular, went barely untouched during the superstorm Sandy, while other areas very close by were hit very hard; it seemed almost a miracle how little we were effected by the storm. We have never experienced flooding on the streets either."
Flushing_742160a0-4455-461f-80ea-4d47ce8f6feb,"There are areas where I couldn't feel safer, but then there are areas where I feel the need to look back ever so often, especially if I am walking alone at night. This neighborhood is located very particularly in between the projects and wealthy housing."
Flushing_b0e3d280-da25-4a1e-9a84-80a005f13dc0,"There are many parks nearby. Many small ones, which allow for fun outdoor activities, but my review comes from the existence of Kissena Park, which hold a small pond and is surrounded by woods. In the small patch of woods there are several trails that one cane walk down, and one can spend up to an hour walking around in all directions. There are many beautiful trees and animals that can be seen. Nothing too much of the wildlife, but in the pond turtles can be spotted and that is not something that can be seen everywhere. There are also geese.

The parks are kept relatively clean, and there is a local football field/ soccer field. There are also many baseball fields in walking distance, about four."
Flushing_873a31c7-b6db-4e1b-a07c-72d442c970f8,"There is not a single bar that stands out above average in this area. There are perhaps three bas in total in walking distance. I remember visiting one called Emeralds, and feeling pity for the bar tender. The entire bar had about four people in it, all males, and looked sadly broken down and empty, and this was on a Saturday night around 12:30 am. There is an irish bar near 166th street, which is for the older crowd, and servers good wings. The happy hours of either bar may be affordable but lack any other reason to go. There is a nearby Applebees, that offers happy hours, but the food is as average as all Applebees, if not worse, as I have had a bad experience here with distasteful rice and chicken. 

The nightlife is practically non-existent. The nicest thing one may do on a date is to have dinner at a local restaurant, and then go an watch a movie at AMC or go bowling at jib lanes, though the bowling area is locating in Pomonok. 

There is a lack of good homemade comfort food or anything that may be considered a specialty. Most of what exists here is generic and could be found anywhere else through out queens; there is no food or restaurant that stands out and calls for people to come visit."
Flushing_d375be0b-b446-4a7f-816a-921b65538959,"We are located near a small housing projects known as Pomonok Housing, and it takes up much of the location and also makes it so that this area can be somewhat undesirable to live in. The only places offering employment are minimum wage and they are at the Mcdonalds, or the National Wholesale Liquidators, or at the local supermarkets. This entire area is mostly housing and so there are not any businesses to hire people. The are lacks any large establishment for employment."
Flushing_0c00f80f-e0ff-4bca-8206-10592f715fbe,"There are not many local businesses in the area, most are corporate owned, Right Aid, CVS. The only things which are locally owned are the eating establishments Chinese food stores, Japanese, Pizzarias, Gyro stands, which are all very good, and then there are small 'delis' which are individually owned. There is a great variety of food, and most and it does not lack in quality. 

The supermarkets do, however, lack in quality, the fruits are never very fresh and many times, in the local supermarkets, you will find a load of green bananas and not one yellow batch to pick. 

There isn't a shopping center, or place to buy clothes in the entire area, perhaps the closest is a Models, and a Kohls located some twenty block from my location, a short car ride or bus ride away."

Flushing_5fe4afdb-3f4f-4bf8-a156-7beef1b3efa1,"I think it's pretty good because the area is mostly asian and it provides a lot of asian food options. On one side of the street you'll have Thai food and on the other you'll see Xi'an province Chinese food. I think it's a great area to go an eat. Definitely a lot of options."

Fordham_da076d31-2fd4-4c19-b222-c552e056fc29,"There haven't been any violent crimes since I have moved here. Safety does not appear to be compromised, although the neighborhood and people in it can be intimidating. I have not seen any police officers near subway stations or in my neighborhood at all."
Fordham_1fb2bcfb-5017-4765-83e7-a0c7b500a5b2,"Walking through this community you will see many people sitting outside on a daily basis. They do not have important resources readily available to them to further their education, skills, and interests. I would not choose to live here again. I rank this area as okay, because I have seen worse. Overall, there isn't an issue of violence which makes this area okay but not great for visitors, residents and especially children."

Such as no heat and the supers are terrible at fixing"

Fordham_8450b460-272d-43be-a422-4f9f2a1bab3b,"Crime is not very high, but it occurs mostly in the summer. There is not much visibility of cops but they do patrol once in a while. There is a small sense of safety."

Fordham_5716b900-2de0-4de0-8c1a-c9d215524956,"The area is not the best but it is not the worst. I have lived in diversity neighborhoods all my life. When I move to this area particular I had no serious concerns. I was happy because of the different transportation and being near shopping stores. Overall the crime is not to bad well at least not on my block, most of the crime take place a few blocks away from me which doesn't bother me. The major con about living in the area is the loud noise you hear from the emergency fire department and ambulance, I Mean it will literally be about 4am and the loud trucks would come speeding threw the streets with their Sirens and horns blowing extremely loud!!! This is a problem and which I can in the process of relocating."
Fordham_c0f961e3-bdbb-4204-ace2-b3b457c0ed03,"Although I've lived here my whole life, it is not the best area. When I grow older and it is time for me to move out, I will definitely live in a different area. There are many advantages such as having a variety of food around me, or being able to walk everywhere. However, this does not matter if I do not feel safe where I live. I do not like to be out alone past a certain time because at any possible moment I can be robbed, raped, or killed. Although this can happen anywhere in this country, the rates are higher in the Bronx."
Fordham_008d31c9-86ef-4a34-8fe0-394ed42d1311,"I lived in this area when I was a kid and over the years it has been getting worse.  There are a lot of crimes committed weekly and it is not safe to walk in the neighborhood at night.  The police is doing their best to keep the area under control, they have officers patrolling all day and night but usually this does not prevent crimes from occuring. If I had the possibility I would move to a different area."

Fordham_7c20fe27-2da0-481c-8e3d-5fc94ed43241,"I cannot complain, we have the four seasons. The winter is cold because we are located near the Hudson river. So it gets quite windy and blizzards are known to frequent the area during the winter months. Also the summer is hot, the humidity is high at times but the evening can make it all tolerable. 

So, I count my blessings and am grateful for what I have and do not take having a home for granted."
Fordham_bf5e911c-4719-450e-84a5-638977d27635,"I do not go out to eat that often, however there is a variety of restaurants with genuine foreign cuisine, which makes it nice when I do eat out. The prices are affordable so this makes it easier for those of us who are struggling when it comes to finances."
Fordham_0a30dee0-c516-4b64-b137-f0fce84607c0,"The stores are open primarily 24 hours, which are convenient if you tend to have unconventional living that are normal for you. Also, the people that work within these businesses are friendly and usually are from the neighborhood as well. This makes it easy to strike up conversation and if you are new to the area, you may rely on being given adequate information about different businesses and the services that they offer.

So, as a whole I must say that everything is within walking distance that I usually shop for. Which is a great change from my last address although some may be biased because of the city being the 'Bronx,' there is not a whole lot of criminal activity, comparing to what is spread within the media."

These parks are also being clean constantly. There are also many bike lanes as well but it's the people who make these places look bad by trashing the place. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've seen parents and kids trashing the parks and having garbage bags right next to them. It's a shame."

Fordham_c1939cb6-9dcd-4eff-986d-d4998764a4eb,"Winter can be harsh in New York but its even worse if one lives in the Bronx. We are the last to receive any kind of help when the reality of harsh weather hits. We not that long ago suffered a harsh winter and a lot of snowing. The snow when falling wasn't an enormous amount but months of not getting it removed made it difficult to even walk. Some snow would met and turn into sheets of black ice while some would just hardened and turn into mountains of snow that congested the sidewalks and the streets. This made it hard to even board busses, cross streets and just traveling wasn't easy."
Fordham_f11dd031-1d88-45f4-99aa-3c158319b1b8,"There are not option here for those who wants to recycle. So we do what our resources or lack thereof provides. There are some elderly people within my neighborhood but it remains a place for young to middle age people. Within my neighborhood there area lot of dog owners but no dog parks where one can take their dogs to play. Their is a sense of more individualistic or family attitude and less of community."
Fordham_62c81821-1be3-4798-ac5a-30629cb76110,"The parks is the only resource that are constantly used by people in my community. The Bronx Zoo is not that far from where I live but its not something many people in my community take advantage of."

In my neighborhood you'll find African Americans, Hispanics, Latin Americans, Jamaicans, Middle Easterners and people Caribbean. Some people are friendly but most stay to themselves or only communicate with their established group of friends."
Fordham_36132b7f-cb0e-45b2-a9c1-389a58190321,"There are big drug store companies such as Rite-Aid and Duane Reade but once again their prices are extremely high. To counter act that their are a small amount of smaller chains like Leroy's Pharmacies that are just as good with lower prices. There is two Laundromats and Dry cleaners that are constantly full and the money it takes for the washing machine is too much for some. There are no gas station within my neighborhood. One will have to travel I they needed gas. One thing there is a plenty of is salons, there's practically one on every block."
Fordham_74e5b8e7-9102-48c8-99d0-70ab0fa21aad,"There are parks and gyms within my community. People do go to the parks to play mostly the young. There are some adults who exercise in the park but not a good amount. Gyms can be expensive especially if people are already struggling to make ends meet. This combined with unhealthy eating choices leaves many residents of my community obese and unhealthy. There are at least four close hospitals but they stay extremely filled to capacity. I stay active by going to the park playing tennis, handball and other fun activities."

With that said the Bronx is by far the most affordable borough but the jobs in this lackluster economy are not well paid jobs. Their are either minimum wage jobs of just a little above that. The only way one would find a good job is if they worked for a family business of the government."
Fordham_f8ff204b-1809-4ad3-85e5-aa8ae0a6904e,"Housing in my neighborhood is affordable if one has a good paying full time job in which most people don't. An increasing number of people are on government assistance and struggle to make it by."

It leads to most people viewing Manhattan or Brooklyn as the only boroughs with any historical landmarks which is far from the truth. The Bronx is by far the most untouched borough of all. It has some historical sights but most are not kept up. One would have to be educated to even know about them."
Fordham_60ab8065-4aed-49aa-bd36-c95fc5c7ada0,"In my neighborhood I'm constantly surrounded by fast food and overall unhealthy eating choices. One has to travel afar to even be able to buy organic, fresh and nutritious food."

Fordham_2d9e9dc8-202d-4fe8-b525-d5a6d3d9306f,"Reaction time of the police station could be improved. Police stations seem to take much longer than they should when sending officers over to a crime scene or incident. The fire station seems to be functioning appropriately based on arrival times to a given scene. There can be more done for the Bronx by state representatives and other officials. Cameras in buildings, more police patrolling during the night, better maintenance of Bronx buildings, etc."
Fordham_6791c39b-117e-4152-8117-9f81b52a1231,"Crime control and safety definitely aren't the worst but my borough has a long way to go before people feel safe frolicking around at night. Shootings, stabbings, robbery, gang violence and such are a normal part of life here, such events are on the news so often it's become sort of expected which is absolutely terrible to think about. Police tend to patrol the area, especially during the summer when more people are outside."

Most tourists tend to spend their time in Manhattan however and the Bronx tends to be overlooked. There are definitely tourist attractions here, but generally, we don't get as much attention as Manhattan or Brooklyn. The Bronx zoo, Botancial Gardens, and Yankee Stadium are the main attractions for tourists and other visitors."
Fordham_e308dfe5-ee86-4af4-b4f1-82fdbde0b58c,"From what I've seen it depends entirely on the person. There are some people who choose to work out and be physically active and others who don't seem to hold their health in the highest regards. The majority of the people in my neighborhood have some sort of government assistance including food stamps, and in order to make the money last the entire month it's easier to buy cheap, unhealthy food than healthy and unfortunately over-priced food. Montefiore hospital is a 15 minute walk from here and provides excellent service, the facility is always clean, neat and hospitable. I stay physically active by walking to school (2.5 miles), hiking, and working out a few days of the week."

I remember walking the streets with my grandma playing with friends on the way back from P.S 144 and I have always felt safe when I walked. The neighborhood is mostly asian and caucasian, but I don't feel that there is discrimination towards others because they are outside these two demographics. The commute into the city is convenient because of the LIRR at station square and the R,M,E,F train are on 71st Continental Ave. Recently on Austin street there have been a lot new stores opening up, there is a Shake Shack, Bare Burger, Snow Days, Chipotle, Station House and Buffalo Wild Wings."

Theres mostly old people but they're all friendly. Forest hills is a place where you dont hear the city roaring with car honks and trains passing by. They have this plaza called austin street where you can walk around and buy clothes or eat some really good food. They have a variety of restaurants  to choose from. To greek food, or hispanic.  Over all, forest hills is a pretty nice neighborhood, the scenery in the winter makes it beautiful. The only down fall of this neighborhood is the diversity. There are a lot of jewish people but i rarely see any hispanics or other kinds of races.  Its pretty safe at night so theres really no problem going out for a run.

You can get the majority of things you need from the area as there are pharmacies, conveniece stores (like Walgreens and CVS), and supermarkets. There are few bars on Austin Street where people go out at night to enjoy a few drinks while there are few restaurants where families can enjoy a nice dinner. There's a Barnes and Noble in the area which is always filled with people reading  abook or even buying a copy. There are also few clothing stores like Banana Republic, Strawberry, New York & Company, Childrens' Place which gives people the option to get clothes for their whole family, if necessary."
Forest Hills_a1e2d0af-1a31-4a3c-93f3-7cb9146c69f2,"Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of attractions in this area. But every night, Austin Street does get crowded with adults who comes out for a drink with friends and/or familiy. 

We do, however, have a stadium in the Forest Hills Garden and few concerts have been held here especially after they have renovated. Recently, they had a Zac Brown Band concert there and I remember hearing lots of cheering from my house. Austin Street does have some event going on every so often. As mentioned before, there is always a street fair twice in one year which brings out a lot of people. In addition, every sunday, there is a fresh market open for several hours and they sell organic vegetables and other produces which a lot of families enjoy."

There is a Lucille Roberts, a NYSC, and recently they made a Title Boxing Club which is popular for people of all ages. While you walk around the neighborhood you would see people running or even biking at their own pace. A lot of people goes to the nearest park, Flushing Meadow Park, to go for a jog, a run or anything to get some exercise done. 

The hospital facilities around this area is located in convinient locations and because there are more than one hospitals around, I think people have easy access to medical care. 

I myself stay physically active by mainly walking to places. Instead of taking the train or bus, I tend to walk to go to my destination (ie. Queens Center Mall)."
Forest Hills_1be8d1f1-4be1-46d8-a660-61dc9cbe425b,"Forest Hills is a very neighbor-friendly neighborhood. There are a lot of elders and big families that live around here. Residents do tend to live in this area for a very long time. For example, my neighbor has told me that she has lived in that same room for over 10 years and she practically grew up there. Unfortunately, a lot of the apartment buildings do not allow pets unless you had them before you move in. But when you go out in the evening, you see a lot of dog owners walking their dogs while enjoying the summer breeze. There are several parks in this neighborhood and you would always see children running around having fun and the elders enjoying some time in the sun. 

Every year, there is at least 2 street fairs held on Austin Street and every time I go with my friends, the street is packed with people eating some street fair food while listening to the live music, laughing, and having a good time with family and friends. Overall, the Forest Hills Community is a great place to live especially with a family."

Fresh Meadows_fc3e8117-9d92-4359-80be-a29a03ec6b55,"I love how well kept the houses and streets are, the family feel of the area and its convenience to my school, shops, buses, trains and the highway. I would like to see more full service grocery store options in the area for students."

Fresh Meadows_9178a4ef-704e-4fe5-a6b6-9bf50d36b275,"Most of the housing in this neighborhood are apartment complexes and many two or three family homes. From what I can tell it is very affordable for most. Many vacant areas become filled very fast. The worst part to live in, due to safety concerns, would be the Pomonok Affordable Housing Projects because crime in that area is higher than anywhere else."
Fresh Meadows_34741c6d-6bc6-4640-b996-a0dfce3e18c5,"Many have a sense of community and everybody seems to know everybody. When people move into the neighborhood they tend to live here for a very long time, I have lived here since i was one years old. I will be 19 in April. So yes, people tend to live here long. Most pets are acceptable, however dogs are banned in many complexes and homes unless proper paper verification is provided to landlords."
Fresh Meadows_a6d555a2-5f50-43b9-ab80-348427687592,"The police precint is a few blocks down and another one is even closer. Because of this many feel safe and crime is not as high as it once was."
Fresh Meadows_6b65227d-a36e-4c0c-a2d8-b851cd8b99a6,"In the future I see this neighborhood changing in regards to cost. Eventually rent is going to increase and property values and low and middle income families are no longer going to be able to afford it. However, I also see is prospering extremely and opening up more stores and such to better the neighborhood."
Fresh Meadows_c3f623e1-2591-498f-92b2-2fc5e2171d5d,"It is very peaceful in the morning. The birds are chirping, and there are very few people. It is very relaxing."

Fresh Meadows_01c59246-93ff-4f2f-a565-45d9a7f3b78e,"Specialty stores, pharmacy and great restaurant are within walking distance."
Fresh Meadows_76a8191a-8892-419d-8621-317e48a9031a,"It's a mostly residential area so there are few stores in walking distance.  Everything major is in the next town."

Gerritsen Beach_5bb72b9e-d67f-40fb-aa65-bb2ec706a349,"It's a welcoming, familial community where everybody knows everybody. There are parks and beaches along with a pizzeria, pet supply store, bagel store, library, fitness center, ice cream parlor, delis, etc. "

Gerritsen Beach_6d489983-1cde-4b59-8f56-e7da741d79c9,"Typically, the weather is not bad. Yet, with Hurricane Sandy, this neighborhood took a very large hit and most of the houses were affected dramatically. I lost my entire basement as well as two cars due to this hurricane. It took a lot of time and money to try to rebuild what was lost as well as get another vehicle which is still not complete. Many others are still working on their homes as well."
Gerritsen Beach_fab5e30f-f808-45a1-b76f-bc877e8d2532,"A lot of restaurants for all budget types. Whether it is going out to eat for a nice sit down dinner or a late night drive thru or fast food, this neighborhood has a lot to offer."
Gerritsen Beach_57c06d10-27a8-42d1-97cd-f58dfcb8c25e,"In this area there is not much employment opportunities for careers. It is mostly for first or second jobs as a teenager."
Gerritsen Beach_ab31ee46-ceb9-47bf-8646-4578f1724d2f,"There are great businesses in this area. Because the neighborhood is small, there are mostly mom and pop shops, along with the local mall not too far away. With the option of driving or taking the bus to the mall and to more stores, this neighborhood is great for proximity to these stores."

Glen Oaks_4de8f329-a808-4a00-96dc-a9d1c249b583,"I feel very safe in this neighborhood. There's hardly any crime at all. The crime that there is is minimal and handled rapidly. We do have a few homeless people in the area but they aren't extremely bothersome."
Glen Oaks_f9dcbb2d-4a0f-48a8-adda-be514dff4456,"This is a great area. Everybody is nice and shopping centers are close by, as well as school systems. We have a growing Dog park and many other parks for children in the area. The atmosphere is very nice lots of families and dogs around. I see the future of this area getting better and better. the only downside is that it can be expensive to live here."

Glen Oaks_f7223bb2-19cb-4924-a952-83d12e4f3304,"Marcella's Pizzeria is great! They remember their customers and get to know them personally. I have not had a problem with any of the stores in the area all are very convenient and well-run."

There is also an eclectic variety of restaurants.  Schools are diverse and instruction is differentiated upon learning styles."
Glendale_64df1dfc-7007-4364-a7b7-2e51d1f2e24e,"I like the people because everyone knows everyone. I would change the fact that there isn't much to do."
Glendale_a1b1e38d-1e80-47ff-8521-e3247488093d,"Safety is good. I was reckless enough to take a walk at night around the neighborhood, and I saw no bad activity ever."
Glendale_497a5e6e-d1b6-4e35-aa13-36c04d879997,"I like this area. It's safe, relatively quiet, nice residents mostly."
Glendale_fc96e7ed-bc6a-4dda-b89e-bc9fea280053,"Its a very safe neighborhood but, like any where you have to be on alert at night. The local shopping comlex/ movie theatre as well as the bar present some unpredictable people sometimes."
Glendale_a9d5b33e-cbf8-4248-82ab-323f2d51652c,"I really enjoy my neighborhood, the lack of tree's is the only thing I can really complain about. Everyone for the most part."

Glendale_d4e9ad04-5a9c-4b18-a8e6-7d5789fd5a18,"I wouldn't say it is the best because the best would mean no crime at all. There really isn't any crime here. The one thing since I have moved in was a group of guys walking around trying to mug people. Minot even sure if it was a gang and if the police were called or not. Besides that I feel safe in this area."
Glendale_95e0aceb-3c61-4410-8749-8630d8ed67c2,"This art of Glendale is a lot nicer than the other part I was living. The apartment is a little bit smaller but it is nicer. The only thing I would change is the parking. The houses down the block take up two spots and they have huge driveways which is unfair to those who are not allowed to use the driveway."
Glendale_8fc54350-7238-4c1c-b218-70d365492d33,"The pricing of apartments now is way too expensive to rent here. We don't really have any vacant or abandoned buildings here, it is more of a family oriented neighborhood. The best areas are upper glendale, forest hills, middle village, and maspeth. The worst areas are more towards ridgewood and lower glendale heading to brooklyn."

Glendale_952b072e-866d-4019-8141-3a77a8d7cfce,"The crime here is minor but over the holidays it gets worse with a lot of car break ins. I most of the time feel safe here because the crime rate is really low. Police don't often pass by here because of the crime rates being low but they do check in when crimes or suspicions are reported."

Gowanus_912c0655-b5cf-4a0e-b5af-dced543cc38f,"There are rarely any vacant properties but sometimes the garage next door could be empty. It seems that everyone enjoys their time at their household and I have no complaints of living in my apartment for the past years."
Gowanus_47800765-91b0-431c-8ece-f4c30600a475,"There are several people that knock on each other's doors and really like to get together to make changes to what they deem as wrong, albeit I am not an active member in regard to their concerns."
Gowanus_9e4c7281-9077-4c90-abf7-4d2ded8c2ed9,"There can definitely be some troublesome hoodlums usually after school that seem to look for trouble, but the police usually takes care of that problem everyday to make sure nothing bad happens."
Gowanus_2ecd3788-1e65-445d-9064-58df75f61b7d,"Never really had a problem with anything unless the precipitation was extremely bad, thus causing some sort of trouble crossing some streets due to the flooding or sludge."
Gowanus_93f05f48-ef18-42e8-a960-89475bd23281,"I've loved the sandwiches from Hanco's and there is a ton of variety in foods from all the different restaurants, including Thai and Sushi."

Gramercy_e60aacfb-b9eb-4f62-b699-32ff8bae3a21,"I lived in Stuyvesant Town and later in Peter Cooper Village and both are fantastic. I loved the area and both provide easy access to express buses uptown and cross town, L at 14th street, and 4,5,6 trains. PCV and Stuyuvesant Town are possibly the best value apartments in the whole city. The grounds around PCV and Stuy Town are wonderful and super dog and family friendly. It's amazing to be able to live in such a quiet, calm area tucked into such a chaotic city. "
Gramercy_58f6ade7-c7f6-4bbe-a1c1-d8e61d7f56da,"There are a lot of workers in the area of many companies and many industries. Its a great place to look but there is not affordable living near this area so that must be kept in mind."

Perhaps implementing more safety measures such as security cameras and cleaning up the neighborhood by targeting the sleazy massage parlors that are propping up in our community.

It is a a calm neighborhood and has great public transportation of many trains and buses. The public schools are alright especially the elementary schools. I remember going to one in particular and it brings back fond memories. The thing with Greenpoint though is that it is really expensive. The gentrification here is nothing to sneeze about, so I can see why people move in and then leave. As for me I was always here but many friends of mine had to move out due to rent prices. It's a pity since it's a nice neighborhood."

The neighborhood has great restaurants, bars but is also nice for families. Lots of supermarkets and cafes as well. The only drawback is that the commute can be brutal depending on where you are headed (i.e. commuting to the UES required 3 trains and sometimes a bus...) and I imagine will only get worse once the L train shuts down. If you want to live in a fun neighborhood that still has quiet pockets to live, you found it."

My grandfather, Mario Saulig, emigrated to Greenwich Village in 1955 from Italy and my family has lived here ever since. I went to public school in the Village and had a great time. The school was welcoming and friendly. I made friends with many of my neighbors at a young and continue to talk to them even as an 18 year old. I never feel that safety is an issue while in my neighborhood. I have come home well into the morning hours and had no more concern for my safety than if I were coming home at noon. My high school is located in Brooklyn, New York and every time I get off of the subway and see the brown historic district street signs I breath a sign of relief that I am home."
Greenwich Village_b7696792-e230-4f55-a98f-53ad4d2fc37a,"As always, any area in New York can be dangerous at times. But in my opinion, the Village is one of the safest communities."

As a student, living in the Village has allowed me to experience all of New York city while still feeling like I live in a more small and homey community. I would want to live there for the rest of my life!"

The area I am in, while it sometimes can get noisy, is quite quiet. The parks around my apartment building always have workers cleaning and tending to the plants, which keeps the park very well-groomed. I have my choice of any type of cuisine I could desire, and I can have it delivered to my home, or walk there in a matter of minutes. And if I'm traveling somewhat far, all I have to do is step out the door to find a taxi or subway station."

The rent is one of the main reasons why my family is looking for a new place to live very soon."

Over recent years, new residents have had rebellious children move in with them and start trouble. There are also more break ins and vandalism of private property. Residents have begun smoking marijuana in public places such as the laundry room which makes residents very uncomfortable. The rent has sky rocketed recently and it is very difficult to stay here. I would have moved here but left sooner. The area may gradually get worse if things are not done about the problems now."

People looked out for each other's children. Because I was a child, I never notice the poverty and despair all around me. I have seen our second renaissance and a significant change in diversity. All this change is wonderful. The cost of living has gone up. I still love my neighborhood and I hope to retire here."
Harlem_25a6029b-97db-4eb5-ae28-a15980edfeb8,"Harlem is a neighborhood on the Northern half of Manhattan and is arguably the richest area in terms of the diversity of its people and the culture.  Even as a neighborhood, the atmosphere, culture, and demographics can change drastically block by block; not all areas are the same.  

The best part of Harlem is its people.  This neighborhood has attracted people of all colors, ethnicities, and nationalities.  As the real estate is both attractive and affordable (by New York standards), the crowds are usually young and family oriented."
Harlem_10d8b6e2-1180-47b2-95f8-e835f9496ddb,"I really love the essence and culture of Harlem. When you're in Harlem you can feel the energy and presence of the old Harlem. For those that are historically savvy, you can feel the presence of the Harlem Renaissance and Malcolm X. The number of black owned businesses and historical preservation of significant buildings and areas keep Harlem alive. The Schomburg Center and Marcus Garvey's original office during the beginning of the Pan-African Movement. 

The one thing I wish I could change is the access of affordable housing and the Whole Foods on the corner of 125th and Lenox Ave because the grocery store is in a community where the people there can hardly afford the basic necessities from that store. It would be a better option if small black owned businesses could obtain contracts to mass produce and sell their products in Whole Foods."
Harlem_1e4c46e2-a79d-47ca-99fb-f1c3894a3495,"I appreciate that Harlem is staying true to it's Renaissance culture.  You can always find a great place that has live jazz, such as Cecils or Gin and Fiz.  I enjoy exploring the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture as it keeps me informed about the history of my culture.  It has a wonderful nightlife with DJs who know how to keep the party going.  Shout out to Solomon and Kuff restuarant and Harlem's best DJ, Taela Naomi."

It is home of the Apollo and some of the most spectacular legends of all time from Billy Holiday, Sammy Davis Jr., Paul Mooney, JZ, Sean (P-Diddy) Combs, even Alexander Hamilton and George Washinton.

I have not always had the best experiences there, as there had been much gang activity growing up. The area is becoming better; more jobs are available and renovation as a whole is influencing others to move into the area. I, however, had a great educational experience because I did research and was sure to apply to good schools with teachers who care about and want to teach their students."

You have to be tough to live here because Harlem is still in the city, and in a city is a tough place to live. Every one is on the go is if you're not moving up to speed, you will be left behind. But all around it's a nice place to live. Harlem welcomes all culture so its like a melting pot for all cultures. Music is played around most streets when you walk by, and the people are friendly. What I would like for change in Harlem is more affordable living for the people that do live in the community, because it is expensive to live here."

I have lived here my whole life here in Harlem New York in a famous neighborhood within a famous city. Throughout history Harlem played in important role in American history in general with influence on media, arts and jazz in particular. The neighborhood holds a dear place in my heart and the rest of the city's because it is one of the highest percentage of blacks and African Americans. This allows Harlem to be a beautiful place where many different cultures are preserved. This as made my experience with my neighborhood an amazing one. More recently Harlem has undergone the process of degeneration. It carry along with it rises store prices and increased rent. Although it is nit all bad it just means it is changing like most aspects in life do. Soon there will be more vegan options and chain restaurants. I hope to see a happy medium where black owned small businesses and our beautiful culture remain intact."

Harlem_bba38d5f-4dad-4da1-b22d-13efba76bd93,"I love ❤️ Harlem because now it's more diversity. I been lived for 12 years in Harlem. Before white peoples was scared of pass around the neighborhood. The tourism was poor. Now everything is better in Harlem. People the different nationalities can to live here. The tourism industry is more in Harlem thank you to the new restaurants, the history about the old buildings construction, the stores and malls and also, the police effort to maintain the community appear looking safe and cleaned. People the other countries want to now about the black history. I don't want to change nothing about my community because Harlem is moving forward to the future to be look like 'the black Times Square' please came to Harlem to enjoy a good multicultural educator day and shopping thing from Africa America to Hispanic community. Harlem is divided by Spanish Harlem and black Harlem. Came! Came!  Came to now about two culture and one place."
Harlem_35a401ed-f097-45e1-ad6d-4e7d37f4ec96,"I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS AND MORE NIGHT LIFE OPTIONS.  OVER THE YEARS I HAVE WATCHED HARLEM TRANSFORM FOR THE BETTER FOR SOME PEOPLE, BUT NOT SO GOOD FOR OTHERS.  I FIND IT AND MANY OTHERS FIND IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH RENT IN HARLEM.  I WISH THAT WOULD CHANGE.  AS FAR AS THE NIGHT LIFE GOES.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE LOUNGES AND SPORTS BARS.  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE A COMEDY SHOW BACK IN HARLEM AND OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT."
Harlem_4920a6b3-3ec6-42a7-96a5-99fba3a8d640,"I moved to Harlem 8 years ago.  The neighborhood has changed tremendously.  When I first moved to my neighborhood, there was only one Starbucks and an Associated (local grocery store).  Today, there are numerous grocery stores such as Whole Foods and Best Market as well as a number of local cafes and restaurants.  My particular area could have been considered a food desert at one point but because of rapid development, Harlem is one of the most sought after areas in NYC."
Harlem_bef61664-76a3-4d26-96a0-3ccdcc5f4c71,"I'm a Harlem native, so of course I love it. I didn't grow up in the best neighborhood, but it taught me how to be strong. I went to some of the best Charter schools in the city and received a great education. It's a predominantly black/latino area, and the African American/Hispanic culture is really what makes it what it is. Harlem is filled with culture, though it's being gentrified right now, unfortunately. There's some violence, but New York isn't for pussies, so no need to try to move here if you want top notch security and well behaved neighbors.  Overall, Harlem is beautiful and one of the minority best neighborhoods in the city."
Harlem_1b3614cb-9792-4c00-9d3b-a78ff297fdfb,"I have moved to Harlem about 13 years ago. I was originally from Queens and was down on my luck. Fortunately, I had an older sister that took me in. Being divorced with a teenage child was not easy. Thank God she has gone on to received her Master's degree, and now it is my turn to get my BA. I moved to Harlem right after leaving my sisters home in upper west side. I have seen so many positive changes. The only thing is I see a culture of people fading away. My experiences here in Harlem, I would not trade it for anything. I established real relationships with people. The good was good and the bad has taught me the lesson about people that I did not get in Queens. Harlem people interacted with each other with a sense of warmth and genuine love for life.  I want to stay and don't want to leave the place that made me the confident woman that I have grown to be."
Harlem_402da7bc-f960-4476-9353-84a8af119c2f,"I was born and raised in Harlem and yes, I love my borough. However, the gentrification of the area seems to have been bothering me as the years go by. Of course I'd love to see my neighborhood look great and be great but is this a course action being taken in the benefit and pursued welfare of the community? The community, made up of majority african american individuals along with other minority groups have populated the area since 1920. Through continued knowledge on my  culture and the area in which I call home I have grown to be pervasively skeptical on the changes and refinement I see in my community. A book that completely ressonates in my head when I see the gentrification occuring all around me is: 'The Street' by Ann Petry. The all american dream that we all may have grown up hearing about had never before been so daunting to me than reading the book and ultimately being WOKE to what is going on around me."
Harlem_9c172799-5827-4c88-b434-defc6d4fd419,"Living in Harlem is beautiful, even though it hasn't been placed in a positive light over the years. Living in Harlem has helped me become the person I am today. The schools that I attended in Harlem has matured me as well as my friends. I attended a middle school by the Of KIPP star college preparatory charter school, which allowed me and my peers to travel to places each year from 5-8th grade. Being from Harlem and having a single parent opened opportunities that opened doors with relationships and college. Harlem also looks out for their youth, with programs like Harlem Children's Zone that keep the youth safe and on the right track. I am so happy to be apart of this organization because it has showed me that when you put your mind to something you can aspire and achieve greatness"
Harlem_8b7bb7fe-afd5-4494-8b43-d6c96dbb6a06,"Harlem is a wonderful place to visit if you want to see the heart of New York.  Harlem runs from 110th street to 155th streets.  My mom has resided in Harlem for close to 70 years living in same property for over 50 years has seen a lot of good, bad and better within the community.  
The changes coming to Harlem is Multiplex community park, the projects are privatized and much needed improvement with elevators, maintenance of the units and expedited services.
Harlem is wealth of energy that is positive that is conducive to major highways, subways and buses, as well as churches, museums and foodies.  
If you ever are in the NYC area take #2, 3, 6 train up to Harlem and experience the culture and the city.  Come and experience what Harlem must offer. There is a quaint Harlem Jazz Renaissance garden located Central 144 between 7& 8th avenues that has live jazz in the park with a beautiful neighborhood garden."

The influx of high income people moving into this low income neighborhood makes it harder for longtime residents to continue to live here."

Harlem_6a04a147-4253-4bf6-89d4-4b1e58ae786c,"I have lived in Harlem my whole life and I have definelty seen a major change. It has become very  diversified and over the past year so many stores have been added to the neighborhood. On 125 street they created major chain restaurants such as Olive Garden , Red Lobster and Buffalo Wild Wings. They have also built many new shopping stores such as New York and Company, American Eagle, Bed Bath and Beyond and soon a Whole Foods. Harlem also has many small new restaurants giving you a vibe of the Upper West Side. It has become somewhere that is cleaner and safer to live. I think that because of all the changes being made more people are moving into Harlem especially because the cost of living is a little less than living in any other part of manhattan."
Harlem_1664c802-cb7a-471f-9590-b46b39e2711b,"The one thing I love about Harlem is its immediate art presence and historical significance. Everywhere you go, there are constant reminders of the artistic pioneers that helped shape the diversity in Harlem we see today. Whether it be through the graffiti laden walls on 106th street and Park avenue, or even the many different ethnic communities living in the general neighborhood of Spanish Harlem, its a neighborhood thats always bringing fresh and vibrant elements to its people."
Harlem_dded6af9-7f54-47ed-9d28-c25afe34bfbe,"West Harlem is nicer than East Harlem - try to avoid going to that side. West Harlem is safe to walk around in even late at night. Close to Morningside Park and Grand Central Park. Lots of 'mall store' shopping along 125th St. Tons of 24 hours delis. Lots of subway stations that are convenient. A/B/C/D on West Harlem - 1/2/3 more east."

It's pushed me to my limits in regards to expanding my territory. I love this place. It's filled with REALLY delicious food, fun places to hang out for nightlife, and pretty okay people. The real estate is really booming as many people are looking to Harlem as a place to live now, and one thing that cannot be beat is the location! It's literally 30 minutes away from everything in Manhattan. I love it! I believe everyone should visit Harlem at least once in their lives."
Harlem_ba5b7ee4-330b-47b0-830c-4a870cccd145,"Deep Harlem is quite exotic neighborhood. Due to high cost of living, the local persona is changing rapidly. More and more we see different ethnicity moving in. All color, different origins, all ages, couples, singles, families. It is a real Babel Tower. 

The great advantage is that will help local business to profit and possibly more new business to move in."

Harlem has so much culture and history that many people don't know about, Such as Striver's Row' which is a historic district located on both sides of West 138th and West 139th Streets between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard  and Frederick Douglass Boulevard. Harlem is a neighborhood always worth a visit. One can see that New York is alive. During the years there are a lot of changes from a rather dangerous neighborhood to an attractive place to live."

A dynamic atmosphere is spread around communal gathering, street event/concert, a great access to transportation, growing food amenities, and a well defined identity! . A lot of potential is existing, and a civic progressive movement keeps nurturing the proud and familial atmosphere that was initially present at the biggest neighborhood of New york. Cleaner street, more flowers/plants, a larger diversity of food (more vegetable orientated food), more promotion of the local events (with board, or panel), a better display of landmark (some streets/monuments are historically recognized but not advertised) and education of the neighborhood (business owner, inhabitant, commuter) would give back the pride that the neighborhood deserve.

Harlem_4b01ed48-3d7f-405b-aed2-b3cc34c10547,"I moved here with my mother and my little sister in 2010 and didn't know what to expect. The streets were bustling with kids playing double dutch with each other, the elders speaking amongst each other about life in the south and the mothers laughing with high tone voices about their children going to college. My apartment compared to where I previous lived is much smaller in every aspect. I have the beautiful view of Columbia University, yet I have the view of a mother struggling to afford rent in this neighborhood. Whenever my mother would receive a raise from her job, our building management would increase the rent whereby, it's impossible to keep a balance of  other bills. It's brutal to see single mothers trying to do better for their children with a giant wall of Financial Literacy blocking their way. When we moved into the apartment, we walked into an uncleaned placed: the bathroom sink and toilet were molded,the stove was black, the floor looked as if someone was trying to burn down the place, the sealing had molds and the kitchen sink is ripped. My mother always tried to make her voice be heard in the building but everyone was too afraid to make a change. why is that you pay $1200-$1800 in rent for a one-two bedrooms with the quality low as living in the projects ? Why is that the government chooses to provide all the benefits to families who won't utilize the resource for their future yet get the benefits because they are ''below the income household line'' ? Harlem is my home, it is where I feel safe and comfortable. With my neighborhood being gentrified, it seems as if the neighbors don't socialize with each other anymore. The poor quality of housing the in black communities makes it hard for a family of one or two or three to keep up with society such as figuring out if they should pay the phone bill or buy food for dinner."

Rarely do we hear about shootings but they do happen at times. I haven't recalled hearing of any robberies in my area so that is good. The police aren't always around the area but whenever there is an incident, you will see them around. The police do arrive in emergencies quickly and that I believe is very good."

Most persons are friendly, respectable and will assist in situations when necessary but is not limited to simple acts like opening the door for a friend. Its a central location so I do have easy and quick access to many locations and most subway lines. Its not a noisy place until you go outside. When I am in my apartment outside is like another world to me as inside is so quiet. Certainly I would choose to live here again if I could do it all over. I rank this area higher than most others in my state and country. It is very convenient and central. For the future, I can only see this place getting better.

Before police would have people handcuffed on the floors in buildings, you always had to walk with at least one other person and now its pretty safe to walk alone even in the night.

There may be nights where there are creepy people, or people who are not thinking straight in the moment but usually your fine. There is also not much graffiti, or vandelism, maybe some homeless people steal some bread, or fruit but other than that it seems fine."

Harlem_201a11f4-cac1-4fd8-a1cc-1aeadc15751b,"This neighborhood is extremely family oriented most of us have known each other growing up, so through all negative circumstances we remain united. Most of the events in the community have come to an end years ago, due to the fact that our community center was shut down. Neighborhood trips and block parties were all established within the community center administration. I don't like the fact that we don't have a dog park because almost of us have pets. Some people are afraid of dogs so it would be useful to have an isolated area where pets can be walked and play. I also believe less loitering and trespassing would occur if NYCHA had security in building lobbies."

Once they've established their environment, I believe families will start moving in as well and in a few years this part of Harlem will become just as unaffordable as the lower east side is today. This rapid transformation is not new to NY, it's been seen in cities such as London, where working professionals are forced to rent or move out of the city due to rapid expansion of upper middle class professionals pushing out the lower socioeconomic classes. Therefore, in this changing time, it's a great place to live and experience the change first hand."
Harlem_31eb0e29-e511-48b9-94b6-eb5689293820,"Since this is an uptown neighborhood, it is common to have a higher crime rate. I never really feel like my safety is in danger and there are many more places in New York that are much more unsafe."

Harlem_206d147b-2ed2-41b7-a050-dda255b67e74,"The neighborhood needs improving, there are improvements in businesses/restaurants opening up in the area, but not in housing or cleanliness. I believe the best thing for the neighborhood would be to get others involved with the community, so that they feel a sense of ownership of it. For example the streets are very dirty, the schools aren't the best, and there is a lot of loitering that isn't being monitored. Unfortunately the hanging out is the product of the men who are selling drugs. The Mayor or Governor should provide temporary ( that could lead to permanent with he right resources) employment opportunities for young men and women, like cleaning up the parks and inner city street; which is something that is mostly done in the summer months to NYC parks. As far as the schools, they need to be monitored on their integrity by forcing schools to meet grade and graduation requirements, and failure to do so would result in the closing of the school. In other areas like the lower west side, the streets are cleaner, and the only traffic I've experienced, is due to the big businesses. The schools seem to be better as well; they generate more on time graduates."
Harlem_44f7c7a7-3f5d-4d4c-a274-dd6c68ca6d10,"I love the area. There's a lot to do and places to go, such as clothing stores and restaurants. I just wish it was more affordable for people to live."

On average, you will probably see at least one police car each day but that is common throughout the whole city. Sometimes you will see the police at subway stations. My safety concern pertains to groups of men always standing on the sidewalks at all times of the day and nights."
Harlem_41b0eeee-94d1-4d90-98a7-080eedc523fb,"Initially rent was much more affordable than other parts of the city. However, now building owners are more than happy to remove the current tenants and renovate the apartments, so that they can start a new lease and increase the rent, a rent that most latinos won't be able to pay. It would be better if the supermarkets provided better quality fruits, vegetables, and meat. New housing is being built, which is great, but it is also at a higher rent which is not proportional to the increase (or lack thereof) of the people's wages."

There are occasional speeding incidents and reckless motorcyclist that like to race through the area, but pedestrians are safe most of the time.

A healthy single mother who isn't working can get food stamps and full coverage for her children. A young man out too late at night alone could be harassed my police."

I know what it's like to live in other environments thanks to that experience and going away to school. It's okay to live here if you're willing to live in glorified poverty, living paycheck to paycheck and living in your mom's house on tips just so you can go to the hottest bars on the one day off you have from work per week. Wealthier people have been taking advantage of the old, run down properties, de-located  (not re-located) people who had been living here for generations, renovated properties into tiny studios at 1000/month with no utilities included. But five units in the new building are rent-stabilized and for low-income... with a credit check.

It's bittersweet to see my neighborhood flourish with new hip business, but the high prices don't match the local budget... it matches the new residents' budget."

Many of the professional sectors only offer internships and most young people and young people with children have to work two jobs to sustain small rentals at astronomical prices.

The tension represented by those opposite ends of the spectrum living together creates a surprising culture of acceptance. No matter where you came from, there's a place for you here. 

My only complaint is that, not unlike many areas of large cities, it is often dirtier than I think it deserves because of the nightlife scene."

It was once a laundry room, but it couldn't keep up with the water bills.  We need positive businesses and people to care for the neighborhood a little more.  There are houses and apartment in the neighborhood which is a plus. There are parks which I lot of people don't take advance of."

Highbridge_e63aff2b-3459-4d61-ba08-830160aa04e5,"Overall, living where I do has taught me a lot about who I am and where I want to be in life. I've been surround by so many people who don't see nothing better for themselves then just staying in the same location they've always been in. In a state of not wanting to succeed and make a better living for themselves. They seem to be satisfied with the lives they live. But once some one makes it out of the cycle, just as I did, they all seem to support you and make sure you make a good name for your self and motivate you to do better. Many people whom live around me all have wise words of wisdom. They've all shared stories with me on how they wish they could change their lives or go back and change the mistakes they've made in the past to have a brighter future. But don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else if I could. This community is like a big family watching over each other make wanting the smart ones to stay in school and stay out of trouble for their better being."

Highbridge_d56c2cbb-23f8-4798-b019-2378d410cf0a,"The buses and trains are generally on time, but the services provided by the workers is not always the best. I remember once I was in the BX11 and a lady was getting in the bus while holding her baby in one arm and the babycar in the other. She was moving slowly because she did not want to fall but the driver started moving inmediately he closed the door and almost made the lady fall. She complained in Spanish and he knew she was talking to him, but he ignored her. There is also a language barrier with the workers who only know Spanish and the Hispanic people. They are not patient and they are not nice when somebody who does not understand English correctly is having problems."

Inwood_dc6741a8-d780-4987-bc57-45a8b1c08ac4,"I've been living in this area for 10 years now and I've seen it grow. A lot of restaurants like Starbucks are now opening, crime safety it's way better than before, people are friendly and helpful, the only thing I'm hoping could be improve in the future its rent, this area would be great a lower rent and I think this area will keep improving."
Inwood_51d372f2-b87c-4d5d-b0a5-54824971f345,"Very diverse. Lots of places to eat. Things are always open 24/7. People are always out. Very cultural. Feels like a home away from home. Very good food."

Inwood_a501a9aa-d76e-453f-bb37-31001761fcf2,"I don't mind this neighborhood, It's not the best or the worst.  It's convenient to many things, though."
Inwood_b49a4efb-5e1d-40c4-b043-c438cf732afa,"There is a variety of seasons in this area, when it's summer you know it and when it's winter you feel it also. The weather did not impact me dramatically. As long as I checked the weather before I left the house it was relatively good, rarely any surprising weather changes."
Inwood_7a1f8793-a68b-4bc6-b537-d1cba6beeb42,"The housing in the area was pretty good depending on if you are comfortable with apartment sized living spaces. I did not see any abandoned properties. The cost of living is about 3-4000 dollars per month and the best place in my opinion to reside is Inwood."
Inwood_bd734977-c53a-48b5-9bc0-c8fab7933501,"I felt safe in my area, but that doesn't mean their was absolutely no crime that happened while I lived there. I knew that the police were involved in the area but I never needed to call them, therefore I do not know how effective they are. But I did know of some minor crimes that took place but not major ones."
Inwood_f6232305-20fd-4cd5-932a-b9c32194a49a,"The neighbors that I had while living their were very friendly. They opened up doors for me and if I needed help carrying luggage someone always offered a helping hand. Saying hello to a neighbor when you saw him/her was very normal."
Inwood_c65e5c18-13db-4982-80b4-da38cf2508cb,"The food near this area was very good and based on the amount of people who went out at night so were the drinks."
Inwood_ed320fb7-6649-4d27-b9fb-1f78c05186a4,"I am not inclined to really give a full opinion on this question because I did not apply for any jobs in the area. But based on observation the job outlook looked average. If you had experience and knew people in the area you were definitely favored more than ones who did not."
Inwood_0ff317bf-5c5c-4a17-8ffe-cee54c01d641,"The area that I lived in was very convenient and affordable, their were coffee shops, restaurants, laundry mats, shops, and many more. I typically favored the coffee shops because they were very unique and comfortable. The laundry mats were convenient and almost always available when I needed  them and the customer service was polite and welcoming. The shops were average, not my favorite but matched the uniqueness of the area!"
Inwood_4a7b577b-5d78-4fd7-af9a-7ac2fe41c62c,"Really great parks but accessibility but hiking trails aren't maintained"

Inwood_8adc6182-ab26-41bb-a58b-f2b303f0791b,"I hardly visit the restaurants as I stated in last page, I'm not into drinking and partying. Food quality in most of these establishments are a second thought to drinks and entertainment."
Inwood_344aff06-ffd4-41fb-9bad-fbcea747f77c,"Inwood is a changing neighborhood. The supermarkets are limited. The big draw in the last few years is the restaurants that are basically a night scene for younger people. They call my adjacent block Alcohol Alley, and I've seen it on the news twice for a problematic situation to living conditions. Noise, general partying disturbances to neighbors. There are many rats, mice and roaches. The other stores are just so-so. You can survive here by getting basics within walking distances."
Inwood_23791581-52a6-4167-8546-654aa481c500,"Its great because crime such as homicide, selling of drugs and robbery barely happens and neighbors are alert to call the police and make sure the crime is solve on time"
Inwood_4bf11a6b-0617-4981-980f-a7eaf07870df,"Here public services are quick, fast and very convenient, fire departments are near by for any quick emergency, police cars and police trucks are always found around this area, ambulances and paramedics are just as much found here as fire trucks."
Inwood_75ad3701-ecc6-4b1b-bc0c-9f3711b592be,"Jobs around this area, are not as good when it comes to how much it would pay, but restaurants are in abundance over here and requires skilled people for cooking and not skilled for cleaning or other things, also many clubs around here need security guards, supermarkets need clerks, people for packing, so jobs such as chefs, maintenance and construction workers are top employers around here"
Inwood_26ff64ed-45c5-4c7f-aace-9445b780be36,"Very few Rain, not much of storms maybe once in a year, not affected by tornadoes, hurricane or earthquakes."
Inwood_4492f7b3-2542-48ba-ad00-14201f84cb15,"Restaurants such as La Tina, Floridita, La nueva Espana, are great restaurant that offer tropical drinks/ Hispanic food."
Inwood_36985531-f607-477e-9f74-b30d1d0eaf47,"Most stores are very close and its easy to get there by walking. Stores such as Jimmy Jazz, Jeans Bar, Footlocker are very easily found and close to this area. These stores are some of the popular ones among sneakers and clothes, other stores such as Game stop and Best Buy are good stores as well"
Inwood_db490d4d-f988-4366-96a4-0c363c53a242,"There is crime, but there is a sense of safety in numbers and your neighborhood looking out for their own."
Inwood_931fe253-c2db-4c77-9926-f634ea9f65b3,"It is a condensed urban area so there are lots of apartment buildings and it is hugely populated. The area is being advertised more so there is a new influx of people moving into the area."
Inwood_865edc8d-cd8e-42ae-854f-1161a58ef91c,"It's okay as long as you aren't just used to one type of temperature. We experience all four seasons to their fullest extent."
Inwood_64246db5-6d0b-42a8-a7e0-81d44fcf8446,"There is a great variety of stores and because it is an urban area they are usually open late or at least for a certain time on a daily basis. Big emphasis on convenience of being able to find whatever you are looking for whether clothing, food or other goods."
Inwood_c1624949-a6d8-46ef-908d-7da21a1faefc,"There are sufficient enough parks/recreation locations where one can go about enjoying nature."
Inwood_fc1c95da-a600-4073-a250-8a27f9525b38,"The neighborhood has improved to where people come into the neighborhood for the events, food and the nightlife as well. There is a great variety of things to try."
Inwood_7f51a252-1316-4bc3-9069-996c484e8f3d,"Employment is limited if you are just focusing on certain neighborhoods but the net is definitely widened if you are searching the city as a whole."
Inwood_9a879c40-7157-4081-9606-e47e6bb775a0,"Public transportation is a must for this urban area. The MTA is not always the best but compared to other areas it runs pretty consistently. Only gripe is constant fare hikes are not on level with the upgrades/maintenance."
Inwood_41704a91-c1bf-400a-a448-e0c5e56b8fe0,"mostly phone stores, gym such as planet fitness, and supermarkets."

Jackson Heights_2c17c81a-6b84-4487-97de-e4492d443661,"My experience in Jackson Heights has been great, it is one of the most diverse area in all over Queens. It has people from all different backgrounds, religions, cultures. Bring people from all backgrounds together and expanding there knowledge of different cultures, religions which is the beauty of Jackson Heights. Being in Jackson Heights is taking a walk around the globe, at each 5 -10 block radius you enter a new culture, interact with people from different backgrounds, try food from different parts of the world, hear music and witness the traditions of its culture.  It is like taking a walk around the world in just couple of blocks. This is the beauty of Jackson Heights that you won't be able to witness anywhere. Jackson Heights is in the center of all local trains, if you want to go to Jamaica, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Forest Hills, the mid point to all locations is Jackson Heights."
Jackson Heights_ae7ffb56-599a-46ee-97c5-e10836f7636d,"The diversity in Jackson heights is superior to most other places in New York. You can walk down the street and see atleast ten different cultures right next to each other. Never does it seem like race is an issue. Everyone is accepting."
Jackson Heights_55a2b436-d14e-4b45-8e82-0128cb2e7838,"It is a very crowded place.  There is a lot of traffic and no one follows the traffic rules there.  It is very good place to try Indian food!"

I like the fact that there are so many different restaurants and bars etc that you are able to visit. The people are very nice and open as well as helpful. Jackson Heights has two major avenues with a lot of different shops, cafes, restaurants and businesses."
Jackson Heights_8beac6eb-ba24-4bf0-b601-0da9b728d789,"It's a historic neighbourhood although this aspect gets forgotten. Locals are occupying themselves most of the time with their own mundane oddities. Area is crowded and has no infrastructure, lots of inexpensive stores paired with a gamut of restaurants isn't enough to satisfy the hunger of the newcomers"
Jackson Heights_fdb18c6c-e6c3-442f-826f-93904142a6a5,"I've spent my 24 years of existence in Jackson Heights. It is considered to be one of the most diverse cities in the county of Queens. I like the fact that I could walk out of my building and instantly see the many different kinds of cultural characteristics like ethnic restaurants, American coffee shops, such as Starbucks or dunking donuts, hispanic bars and lounges. Aside from the cultural diversity, transportation is probably the main reason why Jackson heights has become very popular. It's only a 20 minute commute to the city. This has become a great convenience for me  as I constantly commute to the city for school."
Jackson Heights_d620f132-62e5-45cd-8353-a78c3206c362,"Born & raised in Jackson Heights has been a major factor of who I am. Jackson Heights has shown me the knowledge that led me into my understanding of society & how diverse humanity needs to be."
Jackson Heights_c1cc8c25-33a8-48cc-9a05-4ec2d02f1334,"Jackson Heights was an amazing place to live. The school systems are good. There are great elementary and Jr High schools there. The trains there are great. In the center of everything, can catch any train to get where you are going. I hope to see the prices for living go down, but a great place to live."
Jackson Heights_edb9c5d8-3eea-41d8-ab64-4004a07277e2,"I've grown up in this wonderful area. Many trees and plants provide an natural environment which isn't like industrialized cities. It's safe and there's so much to do in this neighborhood. Excellent places to dine or take out. Dance studios. gyms, schools, centers are just a few examples of fun activities which are available."
Jackson Heights_9bfee267-8761-411c-9942-77b6169915c7,"I've lived in Jackson Heights for over half a year now, and I've felt like home here. Most people here are kind and generous, but most of them speak Spanish especially in local store. They sometimes speak Spanish to me while I couldn't. It didn't really upset me but I just want to understand what they say so I eagerly wanted to learn Spanish if I have a chance. However, I like it here because most of the stores opens 24/7, also the transportation is easy because the subway trains operate in thr main parts of the city."
Jackson Heights_1e91206d-32ce-4787-ac4a-9ac89180de5c,"In Jackson Heights, you will never die of boredom! There is SO much to do, and so much to see! From Little India, where you can get native Indian or Pakistani food like paan or chicken makhani, which is butter chicken ( my favorite!) to trying out colorful handmade local and imported saris, to listening to the newest Hindi or Punjabi music as you stroll down the streets. To turn around the block and have a guy with a white beard that covers his neck, and wears a turban, saying 'hand reading' as he smiles as you, Jackson Heights is full surprises. Walk down ten more blocks towards 82nd street, and you will literally see the other side of the world. Colombian restaurants and small shops that carry typical foods like a stew of cow tongue and fresh tomato tree juice and jeans that will lift up any woman's buttocks. Food stands where the food is being cooked out in the open. Women waving palm tree fans on top of meats and corn, as they speak their day to those waiting on line. My Heights."

Jackson Heights_70c78c7d-8a91-4008-bc7f-30783f73fc8c,"The police officers are spread almost everywhere. And as i heard from several neighbors, they are very responsive in times of need. I personally haven't had close experience with police department, but seeing police officers on streets make me feel safe and protected. therefor, I think safety is great."
Jackson Heights_0dc81c3f-0b5a-4738-9fc3-0bc6bf649618,"living in jackson heights was quite and interesting experience. it is very divers and so do restaurants. the train station was very close to me, which was good and bad at the same time. it was good, since i didn't have to walk a lot to get to the station, and was bad because of the noise coming from7-train. The people in the neighborhood are very kind. My most favorite spot was near 74 street, where there are a lot of restaurants serving indian cuisine, which is my favorite food. 

overall, the neighborhood is good."
Jackson Heights_3b531677-6bd9-4a74-a898-a3a799f7cf9a,"There is not a lot of police presence around my neighborhood. However, when there are emergencies, the police rush to help."
Jackson Heights_1177838e-6c3d-405a-9738-aed8c7f6dd3f,"The neighborhood is amazing due to the people. Everyone is nice and willing to help others. For example, my neighbor Luis, helped my father one time when he got injured coming down the stairs. He stayed up through the night to help my father. In addition, there are many businesses that around my neighborhood, and these stores are very diverse. There are many exotic foods and items you can buy around my neighborhood. Moreover, the neighborhood is very close to Northern Blvd. so there is an occasional parade that creates an ecstatic atmosphere."

Jackson Heights_34cd780f-8a96-427f-8301-88eda4f589b8,"It's a okay area because my neighbors come out and start arguing and that's so disrespectful because nobody needs to know their problems and often the police shows up on my street and I feel like it's gotten worst. In the future I think this area will stay the same. And I will still choose to live here."

The place is mostly quiet ad the neighbors do not cause problems. Also, i like because you can see different types of people from other parts of the world that come here and create their businesses such as restaurants. The place would be a little bit better if people were a little bit more cleaner, since i do really like clean places, but so far is average. This area could improve if the residents of this area would become more organized."

Jackson Heights_d3508ba1-862a-40fb-9c9a-ba6edc443c6c,"Living in this area is okay as there are positives and negatives. One negative being that there is too much crime here. You always have to look around your surroundings to make you get home safe. A positive would be there during the day there are many people and different foods to try. Hopefully as more and more people come to the area it gets safer."
Jackson Heights_36c348b0-2f13-4486-b243-f8df3e3f2fec,"Anyone can find something delicious and most importantly affordable in this neighborhood."
Jackson Heights_0caad6b1-98b3-4e3f-a98f-b4cdb76acb6b,"The only well known public service would be Libraries. Even then there are rude people working there. But its the only place that one can say its a good public service."
Jackson Heights_4f0f80a5-2940-47bb-ba42-f39eaa2ed291,"Most of these jobs available are more temporal jobs for one. It does not certainly offer any help in the career choice one makes."
Jackson Heights_f2edc02a-10f3-4cd9-9d6e-c04c247aca9c,"As new businesses are blooming more customers from different parts of the world are coming. The opening of restaurants in particular is the core running  business in Jackson Heights. Living in Jackson heights there is always a option for everyone. From the person to who has a ambition to try something new to the one who prefers to stick to the same place, Jackson Height offers it all."
Jackson Heights_3371c296-c835-4f25-9bf7-63fd2490f395,"Local businesses in the area are pretty great. There are tons of different popular chain stores, such as McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Gap, and there are also a lot of small locally owned stores, mainly groceries and diners. There's a good balance  in the variety of stores and you can find everything you need."

Jackson Heights_2542015c-6823-4fc7-9373-510a3c1b2557,"There isn't much threat of natural disasters here in New York City. We experience very cold winters and very hot summers but we have no threat of hurricanes, tornadoes, or droughts. Our springs and falls are very mild. I would overall describe our weather as great."
Jackson Heights_0ddb834b-4b9f-428a-bab2-7a4dc8a2fa0f,"There are a lot of food options in my town.

There is also a great variety in food options, ranging from Hispanic to Indian."
Jackson Heights_e3359fb2-59a9-44f0-8df9-553a7ba3d910,"Employment in my neighborhood is okay. I would say it's mainly good for teenagers and young adults looking for a part time job working in a retail store or food business. There aren't many office jobs or full time jobs around and most of the residents here commute to Manhattan for their jobs."
Jackson Heights_6ffcd0f5-6315-412b-a0c9-3f603e98c95a,"I moved a mile away from my old home, I have been a local all my life and the majority of my neighbor's know who I am and they have watched my house while my family and I have gone away for a few days. People who live up the street or around the corner are friendly and never disrespectful when it comes to each others property and belongings on the property everyone is respectful."
Jackson Heights_5bf1d542-d450-4b0f-9fc2-89f2132e7c39,"Health awareness is a major topic that is discussed among the adults and youth of today. Our society being more health conscious reflects on how our lives are changing."
Jackson Heights_c7ce9d27-811b-4661-9b72-abfd1bca11e4,"My area has more of a chance to have a severe Thunderstorm than anything else in the world. Flooding is only possible due to heavy rainfall."
Jackson Heights_04fa34d2-7428-4656-b6d6-46655bcde62e,"There is a variety of eateries in my area with all the new malls that bring new and different food chains that don't exist already in my area. Many restaurants have establish themselves closer to the major malls that recently opened in my area to attract shoppers to their restaurants. As a result my local area has been under development by new Food & Drink restaurants due to all the shoppers that visit my local area."
Jackson Heights_c7f4ecb7-cbb6-4641-b50f-fcd969fd110f,"It could get better, with hiring youth in the area to encourage youth to visit the stores within the malls in my local area, youth employment in my area would keep youth off the streets. In my area youth aren't motivated to apply for jobs and better themselves by obtaining a job and putting money in their pocket to support their self."
Jackson Heights_1e5e9514-eb82-4276-ba96-b4730f35aaf3,"They tend to contribute in very little ways to the overall community, either with the employee's personality or physically with the retail products that they actually sell."
Jackson Heights_b9766d6f-4778-4480-a9bf-c89c219f97cf,"The food in this area is quite unique. Although one may have plenty of options, they are all worthy of great praise. From chinese food, to pizza. Pio Pio is a restaurant known for it's chicken, and Ghandhi Heights has mouth watering middle eastern food. La Gloria is known for it's mix of night club and food, and then there's Kabu where you can dance the night away."
Jackson Heights_86046936-8112-479b-863f-79d6af09144f,"If you're looking for a job in the customer service industry, you can easily find a job around here. Specialty jobs though are more difficult to find, but that's all a matter of what a person wants to do."
Jackson Heights_998e60cb-3a2a-4c62-826b-f0d2b8c65e2a,"The local businesses in the area are typically quite Spanish, but compared to many other cities outside of Jackson Heights, you realize that there is an abundance of cultural difference. You have middle eastern food, Thai food, and Mexican food all in a matter of blocks. There's a Chinese hardware store, next to a Brazilian hair salon, next to a middle eastern owned eyewear fashion place, next to a Columbian bakery. The only thing I find missing in this area is an Indian Caribbean presence; from Trinidad and Tobago, but otherwise, anything and everything can be found."

You are left there waiting until they open and you still do no get a response. It would be nice if they responded with a rejection than leaving you hanging."
Jackson Heights_f298aa80-b3aa-4748-a234-656f8a674e61,"The employees are very kind and helpful at the deli near my home. They close really late and open early which makes it very convenient for a lot of people who need last minute items or go to work really early."
Jackson Heights_76173cc4-bed0-4172-998c-c1188dee902e,"Most everyday products can be found near my area, but that doesn't include the quality of the products. Most items sold in my neighborhood have either been purchased by the store owners a while ago and have been collecting dust, making them outdated, or simply of low quality and have a higher chance of breaking down. There aren't too many complains from the customers since their purchasing power may not be the best and must make due with the low quality products if it means being within budget."
Jackson Heights_39e671cb-775d-4b84-90c2-18d8b55029fe,"I mean I can't really speak for this because I have not applied for employment in this area."
Jackson Heights_9eb50b09-d514-43af-bd81-dd25f5de2587,"I think this neighborhood is alright. There hasn't been many crimes happening here, just something that may happen once in a blue moon. But over all, I would give it a 7 out of 10."

Jackson Heights_21676243-d6b8-4d7b-96a1-598045f1f548,"I have not really seen a crime happening here. But people are not always aware of possible crimes. I have seen police officers around a lot. At night (mostly), a lot of drunk people are seen, may be because of the bars and clubs around which do not look good at all."
Jackson Heights_879b406d-f993-40f0-b161-e4e3c45399a4,"Weather is not much of different than other areas in NYC. But this area is not that clean and so snow and rain really mess up the places and side walks."
Jackson Heights_a5d44ef4-4b85-45a2-9910-f0547aaea44d,"Most of the people here are Hispanic or Latinos and the restaurants are also usually Mexican or others. There are a lot of small bars and clubs which are really popular during night. McDonalds and other famous restaurants are also seen in this area."
Jackson Heights_0494aac4-f7a6-495e-9b04-26aa64265640,"Well, there are a lot of stores like clothing stores, restaurants and bars. Most of the people here are latinos and speak Spanish and so it is not always a good thing to have a job here since I do not speak Spanish."

Jackson Heights_e1fc078e-6ccd-45ee-bf82-26acc92d2244,"The weather is never bad in my neighborhood, or at least not singularly bad. The weather patterns that occur in Jackson Heights occur in the majority of southern New York."

Jackson Heights_66eff2f5-c184-49c8-bd7f-9b819bf2633f,"very safe, there is really no crime around here what so ever."
Jackson Heights_c3a07062-1e3c-4a95-b3f2-3a83074d9361,"since its mostly restaurants and local stores the salary and wages aren't so good. its minimum wage or less. but you can find almost anything around here."
Jackson Heights_ec826fd2-aca5-49a9-86ac-1cfbdfb521a2,"New york has a great selection of different types of food, but because of the quantity of food spots, it's sometimes different to find a good one in them."
Jackson Heights_eb537983-faa9-4eb1-8f7c-1ca40dcdeec3,"All houses look the same except on holidays. Close to each other seperated by driveways. Its not too bad but its not great either"
Jackson Heights_7f8969d9-7936-43ac-b6dd-ea08a0726ea4,"Its the same as any place. No natural disasters have hit here at all. The nearest earthquake to Ny was not felt here."

Jackson Heights_82380cec-6824-4e2a-8303-891e4deb0bce,"Around this area their is a lot of dangerous things happening. A lot of  girls been getting rapped. 

My concern its that no one its doing anything to put a stop crimes happening around here."
Jackson Heights_46306c7b-7b12-4e21-bea2-0ebf21609512,"Their is a few stored where u can find what u need but the only down side its that its things with bad quality."
Jackson Heights_fa62eaf0-85fd-46a5-a6ae-998c73c30ed2,"Sunny days are nice. There's always a lady passing by with an icee card if you need to cool down. Thankfully, we don't really feel the impact of natural disasters here. Snow days are getting better although some streets still have to deal with the delays in snow removal."
Jackson Heights_abe1ca36-e643-41df-8af8-0d9a5b042869,"Terrible police service. If you were dying and waiting for the police, you'd be speaking to them from heaven."
Jackson Heights_feab2e29-a91c-4f08-827d-d47604722e76,"Biggest events around here are parades. Hispanic Independence day parades take place in main avenues and Boulevards. My favorite event is the LGBT Queens Pride parade. It's full of good vibes and cheerful people."
Jackson Heights_6791efc4-0007-4382-af51-baacbc3c2406,"Transportation is probably what attributes to the property value being so high. Transportation is extremely convenient here. There is a main station at 74th street which offers access to over 6 transit lines and 5 bus lines. Biking is safest in residential avenues such as 34th avenue."
Jackson Heights_525001dd-b3f0-4baf-bccc-565f96d1728e,"I will never find another place like Jackson Heights. I am extremely proud to be from here. I've lived here all my life. I love to talk about the many spectacular traits of this neighborhood. It brings a sense of diversity and community. I don't want to be stuck around one ethnic or racial group all my life. You grow by being around people who aren't like you. The only thing I can negatively say about my hometown is that most people who grow here don't leave. The struggle is real and here is where you experience what the working class is first hand."
Jackson Heights_e5a85cab-a106-4503-888d-ed30007bdb24,"Mostly quiet area. Thankfully, I live in the beginning of Jackson Heights and the crime takes place closer to East Elmhurst and Corona. You don't really here about much crime here, but there are perverts all the time on Roosevelt. It's annoying. As far as graffitti is concerned, i have nothing against it. I think it's needed here and there to bring life to the neighborhood."
Jackson Heights_851ee1d6-a863-4b70-a966-10819562dce2,"Best quality of green space can be found on the residential streets and avenues. For example, the Garden Apartments on 78th and 79th street offer a plethora of greenery to admire. There is not that much outdoor activity to door around here besides walk your dog, bike ride, and plant."
Jackson Heights_fd8895e8-2730-4249-9859-58a0081a8959,"Mop and Pop shops are decent, but the community is lacking fitness centers here. Jackson Heights also seems to lack depth in retail shops. They finally opened up two decent retail stores in the past month: Carters and Gap."
Jackson Heights_4292ebff-5fac-4353-825d-2f265aab2153,"Although the garden apartments are beautiful and have an aesthetic historical presence, gentrification had caused the real estate prices to SKY ROCKET. Rent is unbearable."
Jackson Heights_adadff7c-c298-4d06-8d8b-0c5f930df263,"As I've mentioned, diversity at its best. You will never fall short of finding a place to eat in Jackson Heights. It's up to you to open your mind and try new things.  Most nightlife is found in Northern Boulevard between 80th and 89th street. Mexican food is found along the streets of Roosevelt, Colombian bakeries are best on Northern. Indian is purely found on 74th street. Empanadas are great for an appetizer."
Jackson Heights_732c22f9-d243-4f3e-8ae8-32149119d9b8,"Jackson Heights defines what the melting pot is about. Within a proximity of about 3 miles, you will find people of Indian, Colombian, Mexican, Ecuadorian, Guatemalan, Filipino, Thai, Bengali, Polish, and Caucasian decent. You will also find extreme diversity with the LGBT community. This is my favorite parts of being a native of Jackson Heights. You smell and learn diversity by living here."

Jackson Heights_80fdf90c-01e9-46d8-b51d-c3d91ebd6e29,"In the past year, local parks started to show interest in children's health, especially. You can find many people at parks in the morning doing yoga and other fitness classes. There is also more prevalence in cyclists."
Jackson Heights_fe2a8141-9d4d-4fd1-9ac8-7f0bc6ec001d,"There is a great yoga studio, but otherwise there is no gym"
Jackson Heights_2839af25-6ef2-4488-86a6-a5f568f5f9b8,"I love it - wish that there was a park with grass, a pub, and a gym. Otherwise - Jackson Heights is perfect!"
Jackson Heights_0b2eee5d-622e-4ca6-9c9b-ea7b62255bb1,"We need some bars in the area - few places to get a drink. A pub would be great!"

A lot of immigrants as well with lots of ethnic cuisines and store. The CO-OPs in my area are well kept and has beautiful landscape. It's clean in my area. When you get closer to the subway, you may see trash on the ground."
Jackson Heights_4b698274-ba42-4b04-84b4-0077744898e6,"There are many Indian Restaurants, Colombian, Mexican, Tibetan food. But there are only two places that I will only order take out from because the food is consistently good. There is one good Thai restaurant that is not a hole in the wall. Not many GOOD quality grocery stores. But if you walk a few blocks east, there is a new organic grocery store."

lots of young families and small kids. Excellent school district
Jamaica Estates has a one main road which is Union Turnpike  and we have lots of stores and restaurants , few bagel stores and dance studios
One of the famous bakeries like Lulu's is rite on that block too.Thats a bakery that won cake wars on TV.

Jamaica Estates_f617b334-290b-4a93-b665-3e4e9debeb6c,"I was conflicted with this answer because I live on the threshold of Jamaica and Jamaica Estates; there is a fine line between policing in these two areas. I think the police are generally more intense and intimidating in Jamaica versus the simply community watch police in my area. Additionally, i feel as if the traffic police are by far the worst criminals of all in my area."
Jamaica Estates_1d081b37-8b9d-4418-97a5-e24f1ec8f3a1,"I know I am very privileged to live in this area that gets priority for cleaning and safety watch. However, I feel as if it is too conservative for me, too traditional and becoming too closed off from the city. I think as a young person, there isn't much to do because it is the more suburban part of the city, and having lived there for so long, I am ready to move on."

Jamaica Estates_65f76402-e1b0-40f3-a2e3-48a5781ec9a6,"Public transportation, i must say, saves my life because it is the one true reliable asset here. You can always count on the buses and subways to take you where you need."

I wouldn't say my specific area is filled with rich people, but since my part of Jamaica is mostly houses, everyone around me is middle class. Growing up, there weren't many kids around but there were many play grounds in the area. That way I was able to go and play with kids my age. From my whole life living here, there hasn't been any shootings on my block or any blocks near me. Therefore, I believe that my area is safe. We, as in my family, have become close with several neighbors on my block so this neighborhood is definitely friendly. Also, there is a variety of people here from many different cultures, races, and backgrounds.  In conclusion, Jamaica, Queens has been a nice place to live. It will feel weird if I move somewhere else."

Public transportation is very convenient and operates on time. Public Security is very much topnotch. There are many high to low end restaurants, including street vendors. School are highly rated and excellent. Students can participate in after school programs. They are encouraged to attend reputed CUNY colleges by their instructors and parents as well.

I live in a very quiet neighborhood 5 minutes away from JFK. Transportation could be better as far as buses but other than that I don't have any complaints.  When I move out of my childhood house I would not relocate to another city in Queens, the cost of living is pretty cheap compared to other locations in queens and New York in general."

Jamaica aka Dutch, in 1656 Originally Rustdorp rest town later renamed after Yameco, meaning 'beaver' in the Lenape language. It has a distinct derivation from the Caribbean nation: that comes from the Arawak word Xaymaca meaning land of wood and water. I learn something new about Queens and what it has to offer everyday.

There are so many potholes that drivers would try to find another way to get to their destination and the public transportation would be a bumpy ride. The best part about Jamaica area is that everything is close from the schools to the supermarkets. There is a corner store at almost every corner and there is always somewhere you can go to eat. What is known as 'the ave' to many is a place where you can buy what ever you need and even things you didn't know that you needed. "

Of course every neighborhood as it's issues, especially where resources are scarce and opportunities do not knock on the door very often. Sometimes things do occur, and I hear the police sirens from my window. However, I typically don't hang out outside to know what is going on. What I can say is I almost always feel safe walking down the block or just being in my neighborhood. I don't feel threatened by anyone or anything. Often, especially during the summer season, police ride through the neighborhood which also help me to feel safe. Some concerns I do have is with the vandalism in buildings, and the unkept yards that surround the buildings."

In regards to diversity, you will see a lot of people from different ethnic backgrounds. But if I were to say exactly from where, it would be mostly Latinos/-as, Black/African-American, Africans, Middle Eastern, and Asian but not just Chinese and Japanese but also those from Bangladesh and India. Additionally there is definitely easy access to transportation. As far as jobs are concerned, it's mostly a residential area so you'll see mostly small shop jobs and government jobs since I do live next door to the post office and unemployment/food stamps office."

This is the hood, people sell drugs, fight, get shot, a lot of crime goes on around here but I have not been forced to the life because I was not born into in and am blessed to have more opportunities then my black brothers and sisters.

I have realized throughout my life more and more that black communities across the country are all the same and exists the way they do for the same reasons. I want to change that and uplift my people, not through gentrifying the neighborhoods and relocating the problem or sending people to jails at young ages starting a life time of jail visits and suffering. It starts with children and the love and education they receive growing up. This is the 'Black Man's burden' faced with so many issues and factors that are detrimental to black people it is hard to face them all, but it the way to rebuild the black community begins with the community and making them places that are loved once again not 'the hood'.

We also have some more high end places for those with money to spend. There is a great rang of gift shops and 99 cent stores, which I get my school supplies from. Also I would like to see places open later or perhaps a 24 hour pharmacy closer to home. I think the retail stores closing at 8 is to early. I go to school very far away and never make it in time to do some quick shopping.

Kensington_b205e965-e1bc-4de7-b7d0-5a1ca5cfe2b2,"The sense of community in Kensington is very prevalent. Everyone is kind, helpful and participates in local events and street fairs. I enjoy this community!"
Kensington_015787fe-e8eb-4792-be04-08c56d01cf11,"Plenty of rentals and houses. I'd love to own, but just rent in a walk up currently. It's very nice though. A large variety of buildings and housing in this area though, moderately priced."
Kensington_61be416b-07e9-4e0f-a7c5-4a86fb84b4ab,"The sense of community in Kensington is prevalent. Everyone here gets along and is very accepting. There are a few cool events and street festivals that are fun, but probably not as available as other areas. I like this community!"
Kensington_5f0b70cc-9175-439f-ad1c-5ccf883da516,"Not really concerned with crime and safety here. Never once felt threatened or in danger of any kind. Some trash cleanup or maintenance would be nice though! ;)"
Kensington_6a8c6794-06ca-48b1-948b-25e7a4de8035,"I've lived in Texas, New Mexico, Boston and New York and I feel like I have found a real jewel of a neighborhood. It's relaxed and friendly, but has some fun things within a couple minutes walk. It's cheap, but close to manhattan. I thoroughly enjoy living here!"
Kensington_3c62936f-a4dd-4a04-8dba-a6fd30e101c3,"The police is sometimes vigilant and there are not that many crimes in the area."
Kensington_cb77e7ad-074f-47d8-aba6-d92e24d7110a,"I enjoy living in this area a lot. The people are very friendly and there are many good new restuarants. The place has become very trendy."
Kensington_17e627a8-30ea-40cd-a187-8dc7080d2278,"No problems with crime or safety in the neighborhood."
Kensington_2b6cc0b2-eb76-4d15-8d29-ecc8fc772a90,"The environment is nice and quiet. It gives the suburban feel to the city life style. Living here you can own a car and commute to work. The neighborhood is diverse and friendly. It's safe to walk around and come home whenever you like. Great options for schools in the neighborhood."
Kensington_2e5a481a-1655-49d9-9079-3be85c06e8e6,"The crime in this area is in a  level of minimum to none which makes it a good place to live"
Kensington_697c16d9-1916-4dff-a423-0f3855985b8d,"In my overall experience here in this neighborhood i must say that it is a great area of living. The area is clean, the people are nice and friendly. There are necessary resources around here, where i feel that most neighborhoods should have and i am lucky enough to have them"
Kensington_75b995ab-1c2c-4bdc-a995-de436a82fc82,"My ideal area have low crime rate, a high employment rate and solid economy. Since I am a student it is important to me that theres a good education system. We have new opened fabulous restaurants, sport gyms, playgrounds and shopping stores."
Kensington_d77c4022-1fef-4507-a1d5-3864393836a0,"The price of renting is ok. The prevalence of vacanta is very rare. It is the best palce so is if there is any vacant place, people buy it then they build house or open business."
Kensington_ab532ba6-18dc-4887-b8c8-c70a28a0870b,"The community is very quiet. Anyone will want to live here if they get the chance because it is the one of the safeties in new york."
Kensington_026796fa-d27d-4258-9020-cd012685f93d,"The is very rare in this area because the police are visible 24 hrs in this area. I don't have any concerns about this area because it is the best place to live."
Kensington_b14a6adb-f3d1-4d13-898d-b623123695e7,"The neighborhood is just awesome that means they are friendly, and nice. The atmosphere is also cool."

Kensington_6eef054d-b3a9-4339-9fe4-7aa15b91f0d9,"I like my neighborhood, it has good transportation, restaurants, supermarkets, and overall is a safe neighborhood."
Kensington_9618b0c3-8828-45fa-8a89-f94c1518a22f,"New York City summers are hot and the winters are cold. You're exposed to the elements a lot in a city like this since many people don't have cars and rely upon walking and public transit. On the other hand, even on the hottest days, the summer heat brings people outdoors and onto the streets, bringing the city a festive air unlike anywhere else."
Kensington_14137cd9-dcfd-4271-b438-959bef40693d,"Simply put, a wonderful neighborhood. The mixture of different communities helps develop an open atmosphere. Crucially, the high number of rent controlled apartments here helps safeguard against unwanted side effects of gentrification and neighborhood development."
Kensington_036808d7-c284-42b3-93ac-effb50fcb84e,"Public facilities in the area are present, but not always as visible as one would hope."
Kensington_c0c2255a-dcdb-4e78-9c76-780eb5807de1,"Lots of new bars are popping up on Cortelyou road. Bar Chord is a favorite, with it's nice selection of beers, live music, and outdoor seating area."
Kensington_ac2586b5-820b-4336-9b9f-139bd51cef4f,"Outside of a few small local businesses and restaurants, the area is mostly residential. People generally have to commute to another neighborhood for a job."
Kensington_73d325de-c3a7-451a-8115-7a863a2b46e1,"The strong Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities here provide a wealth of affordable, friendly stores and restaurants. Walking past mounds of fresh, colorful mithai in restaurant displays make living in the neighborhood a joyful experience!"
Kensington_9181f0d5-3ac5-48ad-a890-fce5b0ae5d07,"There is a street sweeping done every week which is a good thing"
Kensington_52b74dfa-266a-468b-8f0c-90656d386421,"Probably one of the safest parts of Brooklyn there is"
Kensington_ebf07d3c-2116-40d2-abdf-896c1d9f8ced,"During the winter it gets very cold and it snows a good amount; summers are very hot also"
Kensington_67abb1e3-14c9-448a-a3eb-c19e6c464d60,"Many places around here to get a bite to eat there is a sushi place that is very good"
Kensington_5e1916c9-acb5-4491-9fb1-149bf604d07e,"Most shops around here are family owned, most if not all are pleasant to shop at"
Kensington_1b399fbf-3649-4f6d-8732-a309917eaa75,"Theres really not that much a person can do around here regarding outdoor activities, unless they go farther out. The area is more urban than suberb so most of the places are houses or stores, not parks or green space."
Kensington_0ca4f814-7f7b-4cad-9622-b5c3705adafe,"Recently the weather has been weird all over the nation but in general the weather is pretty normal in the area for each season. There's rarely a natural disaster occurring here, other than like Hurricane Sandy."
Kensington_0ae3c784-db38-48aa-91df-d1fb07352290,"There is only one major grocery store in the area (Foodtown) with lots of mom and pop shops around it. Majority of the stores are mom-and-pop shops but you can get almost everything you need in the area. The gym sucks here though. theres only one gym in the area so people are forced to go there unless they want to drive or use transportation to another place. Because of that, the gym is over priced and the equipment and place is shabby."
Kensington_22da139a-ad11-4e53-84be-5b1048574b78,"This a great small community. Theres kind of a divide in the community though. In one street it's all bengali people (one ethnic group) while the other half is all Americans. But everyone is friendly and people live in the neighborhood for years. Very low violence. It's also pet /family friendly, with 2 schools near us and playgrounds. The school also has lots of community events."
Kensington_36f5a46a-9cde-471e-86d8-1c8b01501b86,"No major disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, or major flooding."
Kensington_47750f59-fc3e-493b-9f79-30b5362c7527,"Nothing really special, average fast food, and dinning restaurants."
Kensington_45a9c815-b1d0-4abb-aff2-27bace3b2f56,"Not bad, but not perfect. There isn't a huge selection of work opportunity for everyone in my neighborhood."
Kensington_6691afb4-59e1-431c-831c-990c56d25613,"deli store sells a variety of items, but the prices are a tad high"
Kensington_ad3480de-cf94-42d5-954f-e0871212ff18,"Most houses are decorated and maintained well. Great place to stay with low to none traffic and traffic noise. No abandoned houses either."
Kensington_f2b3fac9-6589-4be7-b84e-6f357e573126,"There aren't any big businesses in this area. Most are mom and pop shops so employment is low. Most people have the same job for many years."
Kensington_215b3744-ef3d-4761-b00d-bc38ecc8f551,"Not so much job available  in the areas"
Kensington_57474447-3a5a-4822-a3d9-9e1641e0475a,"It's ok better then some other  places"
Kensington_2d96b235-3a09-429f-9088-5011ee6329d0,"I thing the public service in the neighborhood is alright: not the best, but I guess they do their job when they are needed. I feel that the local and state representatives try their best to improve the neighborhood, and some of this progress has been seen recently (Kensignton area had road work and new paved streets)."
Kensington_a9c6ad20-ac54-471e-9820-5b7c24b1f4a0,"Houses here are nice but small, and the cost of living is average for New York. The best areas to reside in this area are towards Windsor Terrace and Borough Park, while the worst areas are Flatbush and Sunset Park."
Kensington_251a8da4-9b0d-4b20-9666-ac42b9f43ff0,"Police are not that visible, but they are always there when you call them. The crime in my neighborhood is low, never really hear of anything bad happening."
Kensington_fbd76221-8723-4410-81b7-22246cd6e428,"People in my area are very nice, and the atmosphere here is pleasant. If I would have to live here all over again, I would still choose too, but for my future, I do not want to live here as I want to live somewhere new and experience different settings."
Kensington_28702c06-2684-4e32-8aaf-110ff2987af1,"My neighborhood is family oriented, so its mostly local stores and not that many restaurants or bars. However, I can get everything from this area and I am satisfied living in this neighborhood."
Kensington_a1856998-7180-4198-975c-d17421ffa3b9,"My neighborhood is very family friendly. Almost all of our neighbors have been living here for a long time. We have an annual block party and great get togethers."
Kensington_23506056-682e-4cb6-b801-6dbbbcdcef60,"The people are really warm and friendly, but most are Jewish, so non-Jews may feel a bit like outsiders."
Kensington_9842651d-63e4-44e4-8208-1e47d956142e,"There tends to be a lot of rain but otherwise the weather is moderate"

Kensington_9ca7ec9d-19f3-4e9e-a21b-3074ab020197,"Decently close to necessary stores and transportation but not the best place to live"
Kensington_328536c7-fa90-43ab-9624-5c604f3a0fd7,"Some unnoticeable crime. Police station is nearby so that is a plus."
Kensington_361e688b-e86f-4e48-a1f2-3678b710efa1,"Majority low-paying jobs in the area, not many high-level businesses besides banks"
Kensington_3adb3d48-4744-4087-b714-d0fb0c7b845b,"Nearest tourist attraction would be Coney Island."
Kensington_b7f08c58-37c2-4d95-8930-fc5ed8dadf79,"Not many people interact with their neighbors but there are occasionally block parties advertised."
Kensington_f8f2c728-e15e-45e1-8788-0f869dd59c92,"People run by the nearby expressway but no gym/workout center nearby."
Kensington_5fa0ecc7-5383-4e56-8c55-95bdd4145c22,"Really hard to find parking in this area. Many houses and apartment buildings."
Kensington_86926332-b744-4863-bd7f-ba7cb046b14d,"Many options of stores to choose from if one store doesn't have what you need"
Kensington_5f26413d-8571-4866-8aaa-5c5279d947da,"Not many parks or outdoor spaces, playgrounds available"
Kensington_19f542b5-1839-4c45-a323-d725f4d3262e,"Winters are freezing and summers are unbearably hot, but people just learn to manage. Boots, coats, gloves, scarves, are essentials, and central air conditioning is becoming very popular. Natural disasters are pretty uncommon, save for the occasional bad snowstorm, which are usually cleared in a day or two."
Kensington_9931198e-f0be-4142-9034-337a0c1cc18d,"Fire station and missing service are great. The police can be fine, but really depends on each individual case. The ambulance can be slow, so most people rely on the Hatzolah-local ambulance volunteer service, who are amazing, and lightning speed quick. Most of the local representatives are fine, although some of them can be a bit hard to reach."
Kensington_04ff9958-78ba-4468-bc7b-15e08ef0a0ee,"This is not a part of the community's life."
Kensington_03809bf6-8dc5-4db0-9ab5-d90f2814c96e,"Most people are in good health, but there is a big obesity problem. The local gyms are very nice and well kept, and Maimonides hospital is great."
Kensington_e59143c4-ad26-4bf1-ac00-d91cff6dacf4,"Although most of the drivers are safe, the parking is a nightmare. If you don't own a driveway, you are in trouble. Big trouble. As big as sleeping in your car for lack of where to park it."
Kensington_43f2e1bc-5841-474a-94e4-c1367eade258,"Restaurants are on every corner, and the quality is great due to competition. If a business is not doing well, they cannot afford the high rent, and quickly close down, so the ones that are open are doing well."
Kensington_6224f2e8-b66e-4c87-b450-4a8277f5476d,"Parks and nature are almost nonexistent. Pollution is not that great, but could be worse."
Kensington_f648fb85-e5a6-4c0e-86df-c0de02c6c4ec,"Pros would include the warm atmosphere, large extended families living together in the same neighborhood, and convenience, with every kind of store you need within a 2 mile radius.

Cons would be the high rent, small properties, nosy neighbors, and lack of greenery."
Kensington_c43e429a-b697-4529-8ac3-a501a5ebcc89,"Most businesses are very nice, and are constantly upgrading due to the competition."
Kensington_71112c2e-20ca-47c2-a0c5-20daf4fadf35,"Everyone is very friendly, and people are very warm. Most people who grow up here do not leave."
Kensington_1044fe5e-c1ba-43c2-8ebe-901d5bc91f70,"Kensington is a bit better than the nearby Brooklyn, where you must be a millionaire to own 3 square feet of grass. The properties are a bit wider, and there is a bit more greenery. There is a very high demand, therefore there empty apartments are almost nonexistent, definitely not for long, and the rent is very high."
Kensington_aef2947b-b60e-49af-a054-456644430551,"The crime rate is not too bad, although there are some occurences a few times a year, generally small-scale robberies. If there is any sense of safety, it's got nothing to do with the police, who are hardly visible at night, and basically busy ticketing during the day."
Kensington_a4cd72ed-dc52-48f6-ace1-6c1e59871857,"There is a lot of room for new investors, but too many people are stuck at boring secretarial and desk jobs in order to have a steady income, even though they do not enjoy their work."
Kew Gardens Hills_7b0158bd-8379-419b-bf6d-fe4df2bd6575,"It's an ok place, I go to college here. There is not much going on. It is like the city without any of the benefits."
Kew Gardens Hills_523d3429-d329-47b8-8e17-692e3a7fd5e5,"It is a safe and friendly neighborhood. There are a lot of great options for eating out. It could use more little hangout places like a Starbucks or a book store. The public library is being rebuilt and it is taking a while."
Kew Gardens Hills_a5d069c3-b863-4f9d-b886-949d02d8ddce,"I feel safe in my neighborhood. The police are not visible probably because there isn't much need for that. They respond when needed. I do have concerns when a lamp post is down. It takes a while for the problem to be addressed even after multiple calls to 311. Fortunately it is not often."
Kew Gardens Hills_70cc22d4-e762-43a0-9898-1c357e3ee14a,"I would live here again because it is a relatively quiet neighborhood and is vrey convenient."
Kew Gardens Hills_c244f782-4f0a-4e45-b049-b87623bd033e,"So many car accidents in the area"
Kew Gardens Hills_3301c677-e467-4ee7-b0e9-a4de23492822,"I love my neighbors we are all nice to each other and care about everyone we try to help everyone"

Kew Gardens Hills_b54d9ffb-3b7d-4f79-baf4-d070561b56a6,"There's great secutiry in my area, but little things to do."
Kew Gardens Hills_399d6b4b-5bc3-4bc1-8742-5b71123377f6,"there are no trains and the buses take a long time"
Kew Gardens_34344c3d-8779-4058-ac80-2efd3f55f2c1,"I have loved Kew Gardens since the day I have moved here. Within this neighborhood one will find that it is predominantly Jewish but there is still a wide variety of different cultures. Not only that, but one will notice that there will be different social classes in this one neighborhood. It is a quiet neighborhood but not too quiet. There is a connection to the Q10, Q37, Q54, Q55, QM10, Q46, E train, F train, J train, M train, R train, and the LIRR. The neighborhood itself is a bit costly but as mentioned earlier every social class resides here pretty much so people find a way.  Overall, I have had the best experience here so far."
Kew Gardens_37d953f2-37d4-4e9c-a46d-fab4c54d52a9,"Kew Gardens, is a small community. Transportation is great. You have access to MTA Subways, LIRR, and buses. Convenient stores open 24 hrs. I have been living for 17 years."
Kew Gardens_1e4e3193-7ccd-485b-8033-5d160ca49a52,"I enjoy the view and how there are different colored leaves on trees. It's a magnificent site. However, I would love to see more stores open up."
Kew Gardens_35bfb2af-dee6-4b48-a5ec-cbdaf128c241,"Lovely neighborhood that I grew up in. Love the calm but settle streets of Kew Gardens. The infamous Danny's house of pizza by the LIRR. The nearby wonderful forest park. That is great for a jog, walk, with a friend, dog, or simply alone. This applies in any season! Rain or shine, its still a lovely stroll. Kew Gardens feels like a subarban city. Eventhough it is a city! Thats what I like most about it."
Kew Gardens_b1863f82-aaba-46ba-8a73-3e2ba2b31f5c,"It's quiet here, except for the occasional few people who decide it's a good idea to do stupid things a block away from a courthouse. It's a little pricey around this area, and I don't think it's really worth it, depending on where exactly you live. But, the stores are close, public transportation is everywhere, and you get to know everyone after a while."
Kew Gardens_9b2ad96a-e89a-4e3c-8c77-d430f31ce86a,"Kew Gardens is a great place for families or individuals who have just moved to New York. The rent is cheaper, rooms are more spacious and parking is easier. It's a very diverse area with plenty of restaurants and grocery stores catering to different cultures. It's well connected by bus and train, but commute times to Manhattan can be unpredictable - express trains can get you to Manhattan in 20-30 minutes, or local trains could take up to an hour on weekends. The area is very clean and has a suburban feel, unlike the hustle and bustle of the city."
Kew Gardens_51627a67-218c-4b56-a187-2b0267ce4b61,"Any time that I needed police assistance, they were available, quick, and efficient. The local police deeply care about the safety of this community."
Kew Gardens_00e7f375-eb0a-4db3-a08f-9875355a36d5,"I enjoy living in Kew Gardens. In my cultural and religious circles, living in Queens is considered 'out off town.' However, living in this wonderful neighborhood, I disagree. Queens is an important location in New York City. It's an urban area with many suburban towns. I treasure living close to Forest Park because I love walking and biking on the beautiful trails."
Kew Gardens_88fbc027-417b-4c05-acca-825f6e87ae03,"There's a nice atmosphere walking throughout the neighborhoods.  The nearby park offers a great place for friends and family to relax."
Kew Gardens_1f65bced-2e1d-4f8f-824e-734d70dd3005,"The yard spaces are small but the closeness of the houses creates a tight knit community."
Kew Gardens_8d22402b-e017-4205-a203-d43dc26fc44e,"The crime levels are not outrageous, but there are many drunkards and criminal activities that take place at a nearby park."
Kew Gardens_b62579aa-440a-4671-a670-838198814510,"The summers are wonderfully warm while winters can be brutal at times, but not unbearable."

Kew Gardens_5f5f2e69-3624-4f4e-8c82-3f42e9204014,"There are some small positions available, but there should be more."
Kew Gardens_a53dfa5e-be96-448d-ba70-efa63ec700d6,"Despite the exterior look, there are plenty of great food places with unexpected goodness."
Kingsbridge_b238ebb9-22a7-40c4-a3b7-30669469bf3f,"I was born and raised in Kingbridge. Since i've lived here, i have never had any issues with the neighborhood. Everyone is kind and friendly and know each other. There is a lot of respect for others and the neighborhood is upcoming. If one were to move to the Bronx, i would highly advise Kingsbridge."
Kingsbridge_f2633d1f-437f-4b3d-8ef1-8a82b5d5e9a8,"Kings bridge Bronx near the 1train. Only train near by a lot of buses though. By can cortland park this is good if you have children. Not many schools especially good ones. Private catholic school near by. Putnam Ave is for the most part safe 231st though not the best dirty sometimes weird people over there. Very quiet on Putnam Ave west 238th st. It's a hit or a miss depending on your taste. Not the worst though pretty decent. Rent is expensive. Buildt a mall on 230th st. Bjs smash burger chipotle buffalo wings subways is on 237th."
Kingsbridge_a3b94f75-bd07-4fdb-b20a-c7c3031e2dd8,"An incredible, culturally diverse neighborhood. I'm grateful to have grown up here even if it might not have a good rep or perception from outsiders."
Kingsbridge_6ea06dd9-de48-4d91-af00-a447de4d3e07,"Kingsbridge has a variety of characters and some parts of it are nicer than others. You can be along a street of bodegas and dollar stores, but two blocks away can be fairly quiet blocks with houses. Occasionally there have been incidents (stabbing, house blew up, car break ins) but this is not an every day occurrence. There has been a lot of building going on, in terms of new shopping centers and businesses as well as apartments. This is creating some parking difficulties. Kingsbridge is very near to Van Cortlandt Park, which is a plus. It also has a lot of diversity."
Kingsbridge_1e22fad9-7ac5-40ab-b4da-5d74d6d6cb7b,"There's crime but it's minimal and not something I worry about often."
Kingsbridge_2d167290-3ef8-46e2-a877-0a38bb18cbfb,"It's the medium of where I could live. Not too dangerous, quiet, but still close enough to the city."
Kingsbridge_465bb18f-0000-472b-9e07-79a7f343842a,"This neighborhood is pretty calm, there is never any crime and its always safe since it is a family type of neighborhood."

Kingsbridge_36c51e30-ea53-498c-943c-ed93da1828f6,"It's a decent area to live in, but certain hidden activities that go on leave you wondering how save our you. If certain streets were cleaner and had nicer pavements then the property value would increase; however, there are a lot of people who liter and do not maintain the overall cleanliness of the area. There was recently a mall opening four blocks away from where I live but this can only remain a nice structure as long as there is daily cleaning. At night, it can be very quiet which is good but I would prefer more police patrolling after midnight. If littering laws were enforced in this area then it would be a much nicer place to live in but overall the experience the past 3 years has been positives. I haven't heard of any robberies and because we live in front of a school it has remained fairly safe."
Kingsbridge_f2e5c774-b5f8-49a4-9c63-c1ff4b8b46db,"I live in a small community within which is a cooperative that organizes wonderful community events - shows, lectures, classes, social events and more.

I do know its a lot of pest in the area, and mice are common in apartments.  There are some houses and considering the amount of rats around, there most likely pest filled too. The nicest and cleanest place to live in the area is The Oval, but are even pest inside there. There aren't any abandoned buildings around here."

There are very few to no hospital facilities nearby, except for the elder and veteran hospitals. There is really no fitness facilities in the area, either.  Only one basketball court, and that's it."
Kingsbridge_4de37437-1a99-4c92-b576-ea6dbcb99a1c,"The weather is mostly nice and normal for every season. Sometimes in the winter when there are rare blizzards, it can be a bit harsh and beyond freezing, but nothing too extreme and damaging."
Kingsbridge_06666dd0-6ed2-4dfa-b027-93c075497cba,"There isn't many places to eat or quality restaurants in the area. Of the food places in the area, almost all of them are affordable, but the food is low quality and not too tasty. Literally the only place around here where the food taste and is decent, is a pizza shop called Giovanni's, and Popeyes C&B. The most popular places people tend to eat at in the neighborhood are McDonalds and Dallas BBQ.  Out of those places, there isn't not that many options of to choose from in the neighborhood."

Laurelton_73c2912a-c104-480c-9bd2-793ddfbc8951,"Laurelton is a neighborhood located in southeastern queens. I like that the residential areas are all 1 and 2 family houses-no apartments. The area is well maintained as far as the houses, the streets, sidewalks and trees. There is quick and easy access to public transportation like the city buses, dollar van, JFK airport and train. The neighborhood is usually quiet with rare crime incidents. Housing is also relatively affordable in the expensive NY metro area. The large commercial street merrick blvd cuts through the neighborhood offering many different goods and services. 

The only real dislike I have is that the main demographic in the area is people nearing or already in retirement. As a  younger person, it does leave you a little excluded."
Laurelton_f6bb9117-e34f-47d0-8c6d-1e304bc88a0a,"Culturally diverse neighborhood mostly consisting of black/African-American and Caribbean-Americans. Neighbor has some nice individually styled homes in it's central part that are well keep by the residents. Crime is low but not absent. Very family and community oriented neighborhood. With the cost of living lower than many areas around New York city. A good amount of cheap food places to choose from not too many"
Laurelton_ab3f9609-c79a-436b-b235-47f682925b88,"I have been living in Laurelton for 21 Years. One thing that I love about my neighborhood is the residents. Everybody is very friendly and always willing to help. My neighborhood really made such a positive person. I always want to be of great help to others, not only in my neighborhood but all over. One thing that I would like to see change is more activities and outreach programs in the neighborhood. A lot used to go on when I was growing up and I wish the younger generation now could experience the things I did when I was growing up. When I graduate college and get a job, my plan is to find a home in Laurelton, and do the things that used to be done when I was younger. I want to bring all the programs, block parties and other things back to the neighborhood. The neighborhood is very safe and diverse. I will always love Laurelton."
Laurelton_110e638b-3801-4449-9384-10f486ddba77,"I think it's a very nice neighborhood to live in growing up or starting a family of your own. The neighborhood has a lot of good quality homes for a relatively good price compared to housing prices throughout new york city. Single family homes come with a front and backyard and the area rarely sees any crime. The area is very quiet and has quick access to public transportation like the MTA and the highways like the belt parkway and cross island parkway. The area is also a short drive away from JFK airport. The area is designed in a way that makes it feel almost suburban while having all of the benefits of being in a city. Merrick boulevard, which is a large commercial street is just a five minute walk from my house as well."
Laurelton_44c4a099-5f16-44b2-8c42-4343962b5195,"Describe crime, 'It's the best!' The rating makes no sense here. There's very little crime here.  The only issue we have are random break-ins.  It's generally safe.  You'll see the occasional patrol car, but it's infrequent."
Laurelton_9979695e-9807-46a0-9dd7-7dfe61d74ac0,"This part of Queens is quiet and everyone are generally kind to one another.  The houses are quite close, but you still have privacy.  The size of the homes vary from ranch with basement to 4 family homes.  There is a lot of lawn space unless you choose to make it smaller."

Laurelton_a9eeb071-8cee-4705-8c38-d161f145d027,"For the most part, every person within this neighborhood is kind in different ways. If there were a crime to have been committed, we would then inform others about any given circumstance. The authorities don't play a major role, because they may not be needed at the given time, but there may not be any results."

Laurelton_80464f1c-45cd-4b21-a138-205b4b0387e4,"Crimes in this area are rare. Not many people are out in the streets, and people should feel safe walking at night."

The neighborhood is generally quiet and is really peaceful. Public transportation is easily accessible along with major highways into and out of the city. It's a middle income area with many immigrants. The airport is not too far away either."

Laurelton_1a7aa9b7-b0c6-43db-8b58-e4e0ad273820,"I'll say it candidly, my neighborhood isn't the safest. Some may deny this statement the evidence is prevalent. Crime is very noticeable ranging from illegal drug usage to gang activity. Most people keep to themselves and try not to get noticed. It's much safer that way."
Laurelton_340802ed-6076-4cc3-8db3-0777934ebf1b,"Outdoor activities can be somewhat unpleasant, well sometimes at least. The parks here are good, depending on what time you go. I wouldn't recommend staying out to late especially when it gets dark. Shady and dangerous begin to emerge around times like that making the parks unsafe"
Laurelton_2b44f883-985e-48ad-b326-2b2d18f571b7,"Natural disasters aren't uncommon in my neighborhood. Hurricane Sandy hit my neighborhood pretty hard. Most of my neighbors were without electricity for days, some even weeks."
Laurelton_ca7be517-ad62-41f9-bdad-f685361cc22a,"There are a few food places in this area. I live in mostly Caribbean/ Black neighborhood so most of the food places have heavy cultural influences. I would recommend some places in my area to friends and family."

Laurelton_9b2e8c7d-e27c-4277-9cbf-94225caa803e,"The housing here is good quality because of the location and the commute to different areas. A person that lived in my neighborhood can commute to a nearby beach in thirty minutes of Manhattan in forty-five minutes. The quality of the houses are what also set this neighborhood apart from others. In my neighborhood people can find three bedroom houses for a good price point."
Laurelton_766a0caf-299f-4570-8a78-1b8119561a77,"The local businesses provide everything an average person would want to have. In terms of food, we have many options to choose from. These options are anything from fast-food to your upscale and higher-end restaurants. The grocery stores tend to provide a variety of options for shopping. There is not many big companies, which I think provides the opportunity for smaller companies to work harder to impress customers."
Laurelton_3f5ec167-4dc0-46f3-881e-414351494a3b,"I'm not well informed about politics so I can't really make a review on something I don't know enough about."

Little Neck_31810a20-8470-4928-b189-42e98ccfa4c9,"Growing up, I never understood the special nature of my neighborhood. Few cars traveled the streets at night and many of my neighbors stayed within the confines of their houses on most days. However, as I explored other neighborhoods, I came to appreciate the stunning visual aesthetic as well as the tranquility of Little Neck. Streets are wide; green trees line the sidewalks; and almost everything you could ever need is within reach: school, library, deli, supermarket, department store, etc. Little Neck truly is an ideal suburban neighborhood to live in and hopefully my own children can enjoy the same luxuries I did someday."
Little Neck_1f612bb7-5099-46f6-b852-d411c066ad18,"safe and quiet neighborhood, very family oriented and diverse. all private and public schools are rated at a high ranking. commuting is fair you have buses that you can take to subways or trains and you have express buses to the city. "
Little Neck_ae5907e8-9121-4722-bac0-f8dd9164fe96,"I always feel safe in Little Neck/ Douglaston area. There are mainly cops around to give out speeding or parking tickets. There is no crime around generally."
Little Neck_6cbe6675-2577-49e0-8540-9304123b89fd,"I have always felt safe in this area. There is very little crime. After living there for years I believe there was only 1 attempted house robbery. Most people have alarms, almost every block has a household that keeps a dog in the yard which is a deterrent, and part of the neighborhood is patrolled by private security. When walking late at night I never feel threatened and there is usually cars on the main roads surrounding the neighborhood."
Little Neck_978d8d80-64a6-4955-8390-c18126b57232,"The neighborhood is quiet with good school, neighbors are nice and helpful. There is a lot of convenienve to stores that are open 24hrs a day. The only negative I can find is that there are no local pubs in walking distance to relax after work with a beer. Some people would even consider this a positive though."
Little Neck_a0090b1d-d7ea-4419-8a8d-819572f9ec4e,"I really do love living in Little Neck, on of the only downsides of the past few years is the high rents on Northern Blvd causing businesses to move elsewhere."

Long Island City_e8ffb666-7f00-4fcc-91df-acae5453b0b7,"Long Island City is becoming supremely hip. Lots of young couples looking to live in New York City. If you can afford it, it is fantastic because you are 15 minutes away by train to the City yet you still have the more relaxed environment.

Very scenic, safe, and has some great eats!"
Long Island City_7feb7223-939f-46cf-8620-f4344eef67da,"I like long Island city because, I they are now building the area up now and making it better. what I do not like about long island city is the fact the there are a lot of young people in the area.

The city has every possible cuisine from Cuban hipster food to spicy Indian food. One can also find great entertainment, such as the Indoor Extreme Sports. LIC's real estate and cost of living is far better than that of neighboring areas, i.e. Manhattan and Brooklyn."

So transportation wise, I'm pretty much set. I'm the type of person that needs to be able to get from point A to B without feeling trapped or held back in any way. I can walk a few feet if I need to buy food or groceries and If I don't want to walk there is so many places close enough to deliver, even the grocery store. My neighborhood is mostly friendly, I know my mailman by name! I see this area developing with many condominiums and hotels since we're so close to the city."

Long Island City_9115faad-81a0-463e-a0ed-4fafa341f24c,"it is very safe to walk here at night I used to walk outside alone in the dark when i was a little kid. There is rarely any crime in this neighborhood, the only accident that has happened here was an car crash."
Long Island City_8aa8c139-002a-48a6-af90-98ae28faf2af,"One of the most invested place in New York, where new buildings are build everyday, with tons of subway stations near this area with 6 subway stations only few minutes away. Long Island City is also very close to Manhattan, making a convenient place to live."

Long Island City_899ab27e-a9ca-4328-9ce6-2fad857d23a8,"Like i said before, not a tight-knit neighborhood. Most people here doing pretty well, not exactly well-off but still. But area slowly gentrifying, with people (mostly young, white Americans from out of town) with high end jobs moving into the area. So crime lower, because there aren't many people from extremely low socioeconomic conditions, who would have to resort to crime (because the system wouldn't take care of them)."
Long Island City_f7010669-3b80-4585-a098-467b70c6913f,"Quiet area, not a tight knit neighborhood. Therefore, instances of crime are also low, also possibly because the security is good in most homes (apartments, two-story houses, etc.). People here are a mixed breed, but still concentrated in some areas according to ethnicity, but nothing overwhelmingly segregated."
Long Island City_873ea9d0-4adb-4844-bdff-46797837b251,"In my area I can walk by myself after 10pm and still safe. Lots of delis and restaurants open until late. Also, subway is working pretty good and clean station, I'm happy to be in this area."

Long Island City_9ac3768f-b409-4c14-aa00-64d804b0570d,"I moved to Astoria, Queens when I was 11 years old. Throughout the years it has improved a lot, and more residents are moving in because it's very affordable and it's close to the city. Astoria is one of the most cultural diversity areas in NYC, with Greeks, Italians, Asians, Latinos and etc. The diversity in Astoria brings all the cultures together to help one another, and the restaurants out here are amazing and well known by famous celebrities like Kevin Bacon, Kate Hudson and much more. Not only that, we also have the amazing museum call The Moving Image. I love my neighborhood so much and if i could do it all over I would chose Astoria again."
Long Island City_a33307dd-7517-400a-9ec2-1defb3dff0d3,"LIC is very homey and close to Manhattan. It is being gentrified, so prices have risen. It is still very beautiful."
Long Island City_70eb4b0c-b608-4f26-a471-1e507c517e8d,"I was born and raised in this area, therefore naturally I will always have a love for it. Every area of course has its downsides, but Astoria is a truly special neighborhood. You are able to get a city like experience but just not with as many people or noise. I would always choose to be raised there, because I am a city girl at heart, and the people I've met and the experiences I've had might not have been nearly as great anywhere else. Astoria is currently becoming more and more like Manhattan, more and more high-rises are being built, more restaurants, bars and stores. Therefore I see the area going in a positive direction, with more diversity of things to do as well as even more diversity of people than we already have."
Long Island City_4e45303f-7eaf-4f24-9a31-7151500d10d3,"Because there is some low income housing in the area, Long Island City does get some news about crimes happening. However, this is very rare and does not effect the area as a whole. I feel very safe walking around Long Island City."
Long Island City_f210b5c5-639c-4446-9e17-60e6fa61e3bc,"Living in Long Island City come with great pride and joy. We host many events including the LIC Flea market, and have many great Art attractions such as the MoMa PS1, Socrates Sculpture Park, and the Noguchi Museum. We also have quite a few street festivals year round, and have continued to develop our community as a whole."
Long Island City_1b10ad0a-6002-48aa-8cc1-7c2664e113b0,"Since we are located near the East River, we sometimes get moments of power outages. This occurrence happens very rarely and because we are in New York, the electricity is usually up and running in a day."
Long Island City_2464cd2f-197b-4c8b-84fa-4844d32f00ce,"Long Island City has becoming the go-to place for dining. There are many great restaurants with a lot of variety and unique tastes. Vernon Boulevard has become a trendy place to spend a nice romantic dinner with a loved one. There are also many opportunities to dine in restaurants with views of the Manhattan skyline."
Long Island City_9c6f4f65-f7d3-4aa4-b539-e020ddc2a719,"The employment in Long Island City is great, but is mainly geared towards the restaurant industry."
Long Island City_741435ff-0d81-494f-9980-728ee954742f,"There is everything that you want t the palms of your hands. Everything from mom and pop shops to big corporate stores for all your needs."
Long Island City_6ef8cf8c-254d-4351-b7c1-74592c3aadd4,"Its better than the federal government procedures and tax levels. Reaction tie for public service is less than five minutes at most times and other violations rarely happen as policing is prevalent."
Long Island City_f93cfaf0-2e0a-4288-adb3-ae9d49927dd3,"Astoria has some of the best restaurants in NYC and has seen a jump in the diversity of food available in the area."

Long Island City_812d6ce3-8c44-4b7b-8ce3-a1716e57e4ca,"There are mostly mom and pop shops that dont really have the capabilities to pay competitive wages."
Long Island City_fdb9540c-254c-4fea-b1a1-538de1c35833,"There is a huge variety of vendors nearby. Everything from chain restaurants to mom and pop stores. I have a butcher, a fishmonger, a fabric store, and a vegetable guy. There are also multiple grocery stores with some of the best pricing in the 5 boroughs. It is extremely rare that I have to buy something elsewhere or online because I can't get it in Astoria."
Long Island City_56dae494-c2e4-4ec7-bafa-64ce3bf655cd,"What parks there are are wonderful, but they generally require at least a mile walk from the subway. It's inconvenient to bring a picnic or to go running. Pollution - it's New York so the air quality isn't fabulous, but it's better than in Manhattan. During the summer there are many outdoor activities from arts to exercise in the parks, but in winter it's too cold and people don't really go out except to sled if there's been a fresh snowfall. No wildlife to speak of except feral cats. If you have a car (rare), there are really good upstate parks. Otherwise you have to take the train into Manhattan and then transfer to a commuter line upstate to go fishing. The beach is a 2-hour ride on the train."
Long Island City_fde02e86-b14c-4fa9-88e4-13ad8ee39b93,"Employment is primarily limited to retail or serving/bartending work. I work in admin and commute into the city - there aren't any large corporations to work for that I believe would compensate me similarly to my current job."
Long Island City_5f6751c7-5f96-40df-bd77-22b16c451ec4,"For New York, it's great. Apartments are well-sized, but access to outdoor space is limited and there aren't enough parks close to the subway to compensate. Parks further out are wonderful, so that helps to compensate. Further south (below 36th Ave) it gets more industrial, but anywhere north of my house has largely occupied single-family dwellings or apartments. Heating and A/C are fairly affordable and gas is cheap."
Long Island City_6670e5f9-1022-476d-a056-9665c8b3dcb0,"It is either much too hot or much too cold - there is not a lot of in between here. The lack of mature shade trees makes the heat unbearable, and the outdoor train stops means we suffer from cold more than other nearby neighborhoods."
Long Island City_52768975-1a50-44e6-87e4-81f7ce8a2fc6,"There have been some robberies a few train stops away, but those are rare. Reported sexual assault is also low, and I haven't really seen any bar fights."
Longwood_8b564153-057b-4eb7-9cfe-ad0f2a01e174,"The crime rate is bad. Constant drug abuse and physical disputes."
Longwood_1501fb6f-72df-43df-b0fc-521086f23aee,"I live in the poor neighborhoods of the Bronx. The crime rate is bad at the streets are dirty. The only thing that is convenient is the access to transportation."

Longwood_5763d3ab-9634-4939-8fab-2380818b61bc,"its quite during most nights, quite comfy place and is very available with the public transportation. It has access to food quite easily such as supermarkets and delis, although also in the area is a lot of fast food (not to sound irritated by it). The sound of people in the morning is enough to wake me up on time for school and is quiet at night so as no too disturb my sleep needs."
Longwood_45882d4f-4a84-4438-b007-605087049b06,"Honestly i think the community is okay it goes through its rough time, but mostly everybody knows each other.

Longwood_09530681-3e0f-430a-acd8-e22d581c3f35,"Overall the area I reside isn't the best of place, but New York overall is like that. Crimes only get worst by the minute."
Longwood_043813f0-5622-41c5-a84a-cb049a5c9296,"The total atmosphere of my neighborhood is more like a busy part of the city, everyone is trying to catch the train or bus ( this area is nearby 3 train lines and 3 bus lines). It is neither friendly or dangerous, its more like a shopping district. Compared to other parts of New York City and the country it is one of the safer areas.The area that I live in is pretty much safe for the most part, but there have been some reported crimes in this area, for example theft and assault. The cleanliness of this neighborhood is a little below average, but during the winter they have done a good job on plowing the snow for transportation and pedestrians. In my opinion, i would live here again if I could do ti all over again because of the accessibility of MTA transportation and stores. What I see in the future for this area is a new mall being established and better sanitation."
Longwood_dd53628e-8c9e-430d-8191-f7d3fa84a90c,"Love to be near the train, but far enough to not hear it's roar. Living near a park allows a great view of my neighborhood. Though it's far from the city and some friends, it works for me."

Lower East Side_65bc5027-bd9d-4cd9-9402-030321d29471,"New York City is often called a melting pot however as any native New Yorker will tell you it’s more akin to a salad bowl. Like a salad bowl, the groups all rest alongside each other but don’t meld into one item that is indistinguishable from the rest. 

This is what makes the Lower East Side special. It’s a village where you build friendships with neighbors at all the local bars. When you walk down the street you are reminded of the grit that it takes to survive here but for every drunken party cigarette bar hopper, you also see beautiful art and nature. The neighborhood is riddled with community gardens and art galleries. The LES has great public schools and an amazing sense of community. It is transforming from the neighborhood of grit and grime of legendary jazz musicians like Coltrane to a place for a couple or family loaded with trendy coffee shops and restaurants."

Lower East Side_05d627c2-3fb4-45ca-b280-6d1d041c7e0c,"The Lower East Side is full of life and diversity. There are plenty of shopping markets, schools, and public centers worth visiting!"
Lower East Side_ec9d9039-e613-438f-ac29-e434fb1a3fd3,"I absolutely adore living in the lower east side Manhattan. I love its atmosphere and its life. There is always something going on! There are many mom and pop businesses that truly make you feel like you live a a community. The streets are easy to navigate and there is always a bar or restaurant every where you go! There is also the parks along the FDR drive, which offer things such as basketball courts, tracks, baseball/football/soccer fields. They have wonderful outdoor workout parks where you can train with like minded individuals. The lower east side is truly a relic one must experience!"
Lower East Side_aaa0bcc3-5bac-497b-9bc1-67bedb66cc4a,"The neighborhood is filled with cultivating experiences you just have to look for them. There are a lot of different things to explore. If you go closer towards canal street there are Chinese malls and stores. It can get pretty loud in the late afternoon."
Lower East Side_c893019c-f307-4fdf-ab3e-6d8f2ec68315,"In the house projects where I live, there's an understanding between most people because most of us are barely making it by. Police are found on some blocks just standing, watching the neighborhood go about its day, but they're not so helpful when there is actual trouble. However, any thing I need is always in walking distance, whether it's a deli, a train station, a bar, or a clothing store.  It's very hard to get bored."
Lower East Side_e19d29cc-aa6c-441a-92fe-6908ad9e738a,"Having moved to the LES last winter I love the camaraderie between neighbors. There are so many families living here it's nice to see them interacting among the bar patrons, retirees who hang out in the parks and local shop owners. That said, at night (as to be expected anywhere in NYC) there are often people running around late and being noisy. "
Lower East Side_271b087c-e773-411f-bf6a-c7e9b29a98d0,"The quality of housing is awful. When something in your household needs to be fixed you need to call and place a ticket. For instance, there are many areas in my apartment that need plastering, However, when you call to make a ticket for plastering they tell you they won't be viable to do so for months. I have had the same kitchen cabinets in my apartment for over 30 years, and they will not replace it because they claim there aren't any new cabinets available. cost of housing is cheap because  rent is dependent on your income. In this particular housing project, we do not have to pay for electricity or water. We do however have to pay for each air conditioner in the household. All housing projects are the worst areas to reside in, they are polluted with poverty and drugs and thus crime. I would say that the projects that I live in are much safer than the neighboring projects. And if I had to choose between any projects in lower Manhattan, I would choose mine."
Lower East Side_bdf9afe2-ca7e-4e20-a8ba-ff29b9510d7f,"Once again, I live in NYC housing projects. We are only allowed to have one pet. There is a slight sense of community because the majority of people living in the area are struggling and living check to check. There is an annual community event and there is nothing else. People tend to live here their entire lives, its hard to move/get out of the projects."
Lower East Side_2733dea7-5c19-412c-b51b-e2abfd738c4c,"I live in NYC housing projects and while I feel safe in my building I don't feel very safe in other buildings or other neighborhoods within walking distance. Since the start of the summer there have been several murders, rapes, robberies, and gang violence. I avoid walking outside alone during the night, I avoid certain areas, and if for whatever reason I have to be outside at night, I am always talking to someone on the phone and updating them about my whereabouts. At night the police tend to stay in one area. I don't feel like the police would get to me in time in the event of an emergency because many of the buildings in my neighborhood look the same, and the police tend to get lost. For instance, a few years ago I called 911 because my infant niece was choking. The police and ambulance arrived 20-25 min later and told us they got lost. Unfortunately, since then I don't trust that they will get to me or anyone else in time."
Lower East Side_90669da4-9a40-4a1b-b141-b49138b5b4e0,"I don't notice much crime besides form the news so it's hard to say. I do see police frequently."

Lower East Side_a4df66bc-3bad-42f8-946c-b60393b610a9,"There are a lot of things to do in the big city. It's almost impossible to get bored. If you're bored you could go for a walk and/or sightseeing. There a lot of things to do in the city for free which is ideal for high school and college students. The problem is that it is becoming almost impossible to live in NYC, housing costs are sky rocketing. and in return cost of goods are increasing. NYC is an expensive place to live. but there is so much beauty to NYC. It would be hard to leave."
Lower East Side_4c6059e7-995c-410e-adb9-0bc80f2d1f77,"I have lived in many places (Tennessee, Pennsylvania, florida, Copenhagen). I would chose to live in this neighborhood because there is s much to offer. My specific block has an old school that is now a community center. It offers free performances in the court yard, haunted houses, etc. My block is full of local restaurants. The Mexican restaurant below has performances and music. Walking around you begin to see local faces. Walking distance from work. Small town feel that can get lost in a big city where tourists are so present."

I know that the houses closer to Adrian Avenue seem to have a backyard and so do the ones on Terrace view, however the Houses on Marble Hill have garages at least for the most part. The buildings are also pretty well kept."

It is a quiet, residential neighborhood of mostly one family homes. Everyone here says hello to each other. It feels like a small town.  The park is beautiful and safe. On any given day,  you will find people walking the circle, walking their dogs,  we are a very dog friendly neighborhood , biking, jogging, sitting and talking with friends. Our elementary schools are wonderful. Our junior high school is very good. The junior high school boosts an award winning band program year after year.  What I would like to see improved is the removal of the two buses that run through this quiet neighborhood. Some of the bus stops are in front of homes. I would like to see the buses running around the perimeter of Marine Park, instead. I am willing to go several blocks  further to take the bus if this could be done."

The many homeless sit along the parks begging for money which if you don't give them they scream and yell at you. The sidewalks have garbage everywhere and so do the streets. People stopped caring about the quality of life in Maspeth, people just stopped caring about everything."
Maspeth_4be61e2e-b70b-492c-a546-cbcb476d0c75,"Living in Maspeth is perfect to live. You have that city live without all people around you going 100 miles an hour."
Maspeth_826dde4b-7314-4b8f-9929-77a378841994,"It seems to be a fairly peaceful neighborhood but it doesn't always feel very safe. I've seen some suspicious people around and have actually been harassed in this neighborhood (which has never happened to me before.) I'm sure that there are plenty of nice people here but I sometimes have the feeling that something might happen to me when I'm alone."
Maspeth_0d700f49-62e1-4d41-a6eb-c17a58b9a874,"What I Like about Maspeth is that it is a very friendly neighborhood. The area is very calm and quiet. No incidents have occurred of robbery or tother crimes. It is very safe for children to walk out the streets. Transportation is very accessible. The only thing i would change is add more supermarkets.  But overall it is a great place to live. "
Maspeth_98162a22-471b-49b6-814c-c53091ea2a6a,"It seems to be a good neighborhood, however there are the random crimes."
Maspeth_bcbcb033-61a2-43c3-a5dd-7841afbccb12,"The general atmosphere is pretty nice. It's a nice neighborhood with a great location and easy accessibility to public transportation."
Maspeth_2269e6b8-c0a9-4179-afa4-deb84625dcfb,"Not much crime around this area"
Maspeth_51125890-227f-4bf6-9b88-d3896d991d46,"There is a store, a Mexican restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, and a pizzeria just across the street from my house. A laundrymat a block away and a dollar store as well. Also nearby salons."
Maspeth_903a90b6-4a1a-4a55-9e63-fff2a4a0fdc6,"I've never felt unsafe in my time living in Ridgewood."
Maspeth_127bac48-92bf-4ffd-a6d5-25ed64da6df8,"Nothing bad has really happened here, so I wouldn't see why I wouldn't stay or go."
Maspeth_73b4eb63-e278-4617-9fce-bdfa7d377fb3,"The police are barely around, sometimes I feel concerned and paranoid when I'm walking at night. Street lights could be a little dim, and the neighborhood is dark most of the time."
Maspeth_01776bd7-88fa-423f-8ed3-d82b1e4cf0ba,"The area where I live in is mediocre. The general atmosphere is quiet, I would not choose to live here again if I had the choice. Woodside is far from where I generally go, and so I always have to commute. The schools around my neighborhood is building a good reputation, which is a big pro. This area has many ways to improve in terms of the community."
Maspeth_f7fb9208-54bf-4f91-a57a-31be9724402f,"Maspeth does not really experience many crimes, if any, that I have heard about. It is a very safe area and not much is worrisome around here."
Maspeth_8237baac-7504-4e1e-975f-0d167f5f422b,"Maspeth is a great ares. Everyone knows each other around here and it is a fairly quiet area. Everything around here is family-oriented and plenty of parks spend some time in."
Maspeth_0b5aa462-dae4-4848-826c-a2a70521b68a,"Although there have been some incidents in the past, the area is relatively safe."
Maspeth_8fe09562-0a49-49d1-a9e8-fd300bd35ecc,"Woodside is not your average neighborhood. It has the feel and look of a small town. Yet, the constant noise from the 7 train reminds you that you are not that far away from times square. Over the years, the neighborhood has expanded in a way that accommodates the needs of everyone, regardless or religion or ethnicity. The schools in the neighborhood provide an excellent environment for children to learn. Although the rent is going up in this area, it is great place to raise a family."
Maspeth_537a48c9-c5b7-4189-95fc-876857c72b9a,"The cost of buying a house is high but renting is affordable because there are no trains in the area, only buses."
Maspeth_57c7128d-1b57-442a-9a74-985efa9f0177,"People tend to live here throughout their entire lives.  It's a really good neighborhood.  I might do the same."
Maspeth_878ddd7a-5311-4dfc-8af6-c9662f543b7c,"I heard of two incidents within the last year of men creeping up on women but have not experienced it myself.  Everything seems low key."
Maspeth_d03a05fb-6c28-423d-8b9a-2a466dff0e52,"I love this neighborhood because it is quiet and away from the trains.  I feel safe walking home late at night.  I take night classes and get home around 10:30 sometimes.  I would love to live in this neighborhood for a long time.  It is not overcrowded and I hope it stays that way."
Maspeth_64e137b1-2838-4dc9-a3f0-4198d22750ef,"This town has pretty good safety and neighbors."
Maspeth_5e903c62-c213-46d2-b2d4-9f4036cecf86,"this town is still nice but its becoming too crowded, especially with Asians.  Every other store is a nail salon"

Maspeth_c0afb6cc-e01d-49a0-b9b3-b2aea26208d1,"The area that I live in is great for older people. Its very nice, quiet, friendly environment. There are a few children in the are, but its never too noisy or annoying. The community feels very safe. Walking at 2am is never a problem. However, we don't have a major, interactive newspaper in Woodside. I feel like people love woodside, but never gather together to help and contribute the community."
Maspeth_ec4c584a-09cc-4769-a24b-cc4f1b06b81d,"There aren't any severe weather conditions that threaten our daily lives. I would say only the severe cold winters in NYC are usually an annoyance. Than again, we are used to it."
Maspeth_f4e90f04-da93-4992-9015-4dd7292ff8a6,"Since Woodside is compressed of many cultures and backgrounds, there is a lot of variety of restaurants like Ecuadorian restaurant, Mexican, Indian, etc. There are also quite a few number of bars there are usually Irish owned though. You can easily buy food in Woodside at 2am. It resembles a lot to Manhattan, with all the stands in the corners. Its great."
Maspeth_0ed880e1-5f65-484c-9af0-0132b488fe8c,"Well, there are a lot of convenient stores and restaurants. However, personally, since I am majoring in Journalism there aren't many large corporations or publications nearby."
Maspeth_99d3ead3-98a6-4f1d-959e-f9d360ee7868,"The part of woodside that I live in is very isolated compare to the more busy part of the city. In general though, Woodside has a lot of multicultural options regarding food and restaurants. You have a very big Irish, hispanic, and asian community. I do get everything I need but thats 5-10 min walk from where I live."
Maspeth_d4e17bd8-5ae0-4863-9784-81c59def8c19,"Very safe area. Little to no crime ever."

Maspeth_2c2f12cd-090d-4935-89c2-a525103940b1,"there are too many nail salons.  why do so many people need their nails done so often?"
Maspeth_c74c0d8d-e1e0-4115-afbe-6aa0bb7b0bb2,"this is a working class neighborhood"
Melrose_6f57a8ca-91ec-4cc9-bfde-812e919d6450,"A couple of block from where I live and at times have to walk can be dangerous. There has been shoot out, people getting physical assulted.  A person has to be aware at all times and get ready to defend  themselves."

Middle Village_147682b2-cdea-4498-a128-cfc0df7e136d,"It is a nice and quiet neighborhood with a walking distance to a busy and charming strip of stores and markets. The neighbors are nice and friendly. It is in the middle of everything so driving distances are very short and you can get anywhere quickly."
Middle Village_0d496386-51df-457d-8544-193648c97b4e,"Transportation is close by and theres a mall 10 minutes walking distance but variety in take out is limited. It's better than where I used to live which was 30 minutes walking from a CVS."
Middle Village_6eb801f7-a9c8-45ef-9b3e-0d66f37a0f1e,"Middle Village is a quaint little town in Queens, with predominately middle-upper middle class Catholic Italian, Irish, Spanish, Polish and many other nationalities. MV has one of the most beloved parks in Queens, Juniper Park, with its own tennis, basketball, shuffleboard, and paddleboard courts, baseball/softball fields, a dog run, 2 great areas for children to play, and a great view of the Manhattan skyline. MV has great public, as well as great Catholic school systems. However, MV is in a 2-fare zone, so buses to a train are necessary unless you have a car. The houses are mainly 1-family brick houses, however they are many renters and condo options available. MV is the perfect place to raise a family in a somewhat urban/suburban area full of culture and diversity. With only a 20 min ride into the city, BK and LI (excluding rush hours), MV is the perfect centralized location to live out of all the 5 boroughs. Plus city taxes are much cheaper than upstate and LI."

A lot of the people are passive aggressive with their racism and i have been a victim , countless times. Although i do not interact with them frequently, the racist attitudes presented are illustrated through many of the ignorant people that live around middle village (mostly white folks) "
Middle Village_8eb00633-f628-4fa6-bba5-dcf64a0ae6a3,"I've lived here for over 5 years and I love the neighborhood. It is close enough to Bushwick/Brooklyn and Manhattan. The only issue I have in this area is parking and that the rents are continuing to rise. Otherwise a very safe neighborhood and friendly neighbors."
Middle Village_1cead8f7-8c0a-4980-abc4-2f58ae10b51f,"It's a nice and quiet neighborhood in New York City; you don't really get that these days. I went to public schools in this area, and the ones I went to offered me a great education. Now, there isn't really much to do in this area, since it's relatively quiet. Crime is low, so I can freely roam at night without getting stabbed to death or mugged. It is a little pricey, but in New York City these days, a peaceful neighborhood comes at a premium"
Middle Village_25b7889a-94e0-445b-9878-77e69ea4b9da,"Crime rate is low, responsive enforcement willing to help"

Middle Village_9c243dc2-6ccd-4e5d-ba9a-92b980928d96,"The overall experience is okay. The neighborhood isn't spectacular but it also isn't terrible. It's a small community that keeps to themselves. The atmosphere is relaxed with neighbors ranging from young kids to elder people. There is a variety of ages, races, genders. I see this neighborhood staying the same in the future. I can't see a major change since there isn't really anything specific to change."

Middle Village_48bc4732-22c6-4567-984f-5c0b10afaf88,"Middle Village has proven to be a safe and usually quiet place to live. The easy access to stores and food within walking distance is a big plus. There are also multiple bus routes and a subway line close by. If I could do it all all over, I would still live here. However, the streets can get very busy, which means a higher chance of accidents. This has lead to minor crashes and signs advising drivers to be cautious. In the future, I hope to see improved road conditions and the same safety level this area displays now."
Middle Village_86ae55f2-1563-4748-8db8-0c84424be8ee,"There is barely any crime in this area. The police are sometimes visible but always available when there is an emergency. Ambulances are also very quick to come help the elderly."

Overall, delis, Dunkin Donuts and pharmacies get the most business around my home."

Midtown_60c2cbdd-d28b-44de-b1b4-b6cfb760881a,"Crime is very rare here. If there's any crime, it'll have to do with the local homeless guy taking a nap in the bike lane. It's very rare here, and the local precinct is just blocks away."
Midtown_1aa4625b-c49d-420a-98ea-317a18a86dd9,"It's a beautiful, very accessible area, with access to 8 subway lines within a one block radius and over 5 different bus lines in the same vicinity. I love the area, I really do - there's shopping, good food available, and the park is right across the street. great for families with kids and pets, but also perfectly suitable for a lone wolf. I'd say the only drawback is the increasing homeless problem...we have our 'regular' homeless, but they've gotten rowdier in recent months. Also, the pedicab drivers and bike rental salespeople are the most annoying, invasive people on the planet - and they're EVERYWHERE. on every corner, begging you to come with them and take a pedicab ride or rent a bike. That leads to another big drawback - the tourists. They, too, are everywhere. I hate tourists,so it definitely gets to me. I try to hang around outside towards the evening, when most tourists and pop-up salesmen are gone, and it's emptier, quieter, and an overall much nicer area. At the end of the day though, these are very minor things in the scheme of it all. It's really a wonderful area, and I think I'd still live here if I could do it all over again - it's just so accessible and so full of life and rich with culture - it is very, very New York, in the best way possible."
Midtown_2ab81883-abbf-4e0e-88d2-204375b68564,"I believe the city is kept pretty safe when it comes down to things like graffiti which is something that isn't often seen in area in which i live. As for when it comes to crimes the police within the area seem to have a lot of different things under their belt when it comes down to the really important things. There are at least two police departments that are within a 1 mile radius of where i live."
Midtown_62b57671-790f-45af-ac0f-fb4ffb0a3423,"It's very vibrant if you've never been to new york before. The people here are very helpful when it comes to looking for directions or good places to eat more or less. The atmosphere that new york city creates is so beautiful it doesn't make you not want to do anything! Once i do move from new york city i think it would be a place i would come back to because new york just has a piece of me that no one else really has."

Living where I do now, I finally got my own room, something I never had for the first 18 years of my life. The community is nice and the people here are nice. They aren't loud and don't stick their noses into other peoples' business. This area will go on to do well in the future."

Most houses and builders aren't perfectly built or clean but they're good enough. Some houses have leaks or other minor problems. The streets are somewhat clean but there is often garbage in gardens placed by passing people. The houses and buildings are old but are good enough to not require reconstruction."
Midwood_f164c329-b5a0-4b48-a1d5-7018ab50eb39,"Like the people who live here, the jobs are very diverse. There are florists, car services, banks, cafes, restaurants, 99 cents stores, pharmacy and shops that have anything and everything you need. There aren't much huge business stores but there are hundreds of local shops. Each owner of the local shops love their jobs and do the jobs for a cheaper price than bigger businesses. For instance, the florist will work with you personally to help you get you exactly what you want. He'll even include a discount or give you a little extra with what you order. In conclusion, employment here is great, but not perfect. No one is making  huge profits but no one is struggling either."
Midwood_d85e4709-a826-4fce-a8f6-b67540ade02c,"It's a great neighborhood now and it's very slowly getting better. Some streets and buildings here are very old and need repair.

We watch out for each other's kids and we simply try to help each other out. Another thing that is good about Mill Basin is that there's a lot of stores nearby whether it's fast food restarants, supermarket or clothing stores. There's a little bit of everything nearby. The only thing I will criticize about is that there's absolutely no subway stations. If you don't have a car and need to go to a destination outside the immediate area, you have to rely on the bus to take you to the nearest subway station. Other than that, Mill Basin is a wonderful neighborhood to live in."

An aspect of Morningside that is difficult is the amount of income required to live here. I am a student here in New York and rent in this area is very high and can be somewhat of a burden. But if one can afford to live here it is quite nice with lots to offer for all ages and walks of life."
Morningside Heights_a0620934-04ea-4f0f-9ccf-25a5d62c9772,"It's an already gentrified, family-friendly cubby of Manhattan, essentially an extension of the Upper West Side at this point. Columbia University is largely responsible for the safety and cleanliness that did not exist 20 years ago. If there is anything to change, it is more housing for non-Columbia students and professors. The university has a hold on the neighborhood."

Morningside Heights_366a3a54-d201-4d08-99de-05d7cc9140b8,"Everywhere in NYC has crime issues. Considering that, my neighborhood is relatively safe as long as people do not walk outside the street or go to the park late at night and keep one's belongings attended when working in public spaces. The most common crime in the neighborhood is stealing people's money or expensive electronics through physical threat or by entering academic/public buildings to take unattended belongings. There has been some rape incidents around near Amsterdam Avenue between 10pm-3am. But Columbia University makes an effort to keep students living nearby safe by installing surveillance cameras around buildings and offering escorts when students do not feel safe walking alone."
Morningside Heights_69750bff-29c9-4c48-a14f-4cdf4cb026c0,"I love the location of this neighborhood because everything I need on a daily or monthly basis are close by (such as grocery stores, drug stores, local medical service, library, parks, book store, etc.) The neighborhood is relatively safe thanks to Columbia University's Public Safety and it is located in walkable distance from Central Park. A negative to this neighborhood would be that the housing is still a bit expensive for me."

Morningside Heights_1659391e-f5f4-4e29-8a61-4df4b5ecefdb,"The local business around where I live is pretty great. The crew memebers of the stores are also willing to help if anyone needs it. There always so friendly with every customers. There are many banks around where I live as well as ATM's making it easier for people to withdraw money."
Morningside Heights_ddf997a7-b439-451a-ab34-afa8176890c1,"There are few because of how expensive it is to operate there, its mostly dominated by big chains (drug stores, starbucks, big banks etc)."
Morningside Heights_1556d13d-1d41-4d11-8e45-82375ac71aa3,"There is a ton of people living in the area and most commute to other Burroughs/neighborhoods for work. There are not many jobs in the area."
Morningside Heights_f48c4b68-3025-439b-9e36-00140f1a8cd9,"The businesses in the area do a great job of making it feel like a small neighborhood even though you are in the middle of Manhattan."
Morris Heights_05b18006-a5b5-4c9d-ba1e-651f07b553dd,"I have lived there for 18 years. The neighborhood is predominantly black and latino. I wish there were policing to ensure safety. It's a good location terms of commuting to Manhattan and Westchester. The 1, A, 4 and D trains are nearby. There is a metro north stop in Morris Heights. There is also another metro north stop in Fordham, which is about 15 minutes away. I'm not a big fan of the public schools in the area. I asked to transfer back to my school in Manhattan when I was younger because there were fights often and gang violence."
Morris Heights_c18346fb-081e-4c74-ae3f-16e753b39325,"I am originally from Florida so moving to this area was a shock to me it is a busy area. I'd like to see more officers around in the evenings walking around interacting with the people."
Morris Heights_44963cbb-468b-4f9f-8ffd-ea5b8fecccf4,"Not much crime because everyone knows each other."
Morris Heights_5efd07ea-8b4f-43f9-98dc-f27530aa5c6c,"The Bronx is home, whether I like it or not."
Morris Heights_8da7e763-18fd-49b7-9b92-7f6ac7bb6568,"From what I see and hear about, the crime rate is what I'd consider to be normal. We don't see police around until someone has been shot or stabbed. That's something I wish could change."
Morris Heights_fd987ea5-b188-426d-90b7-e3d8acd8ce1d,"This area is exactly how I rated it. It's okay. I've grown up here, so it's not like I know too much different. The area isn't very clean, but it's not filthy either. There are a few illegal activities I see, and I haven't seen any efforts to stop them."
Morris Heights_c9db17b4-adab-46ef-b329-501a7e079900,"Crime and Safety has improved little by little, but the problems do continue. I have been living here all my life and I still do not feel safe in walking outside in my home town. When you need police they come an hour after you call and usually bash you on how your situation was not an emergency. A lot of police brutality has been seen in my area and many teenagers have been dying due to our own heroes."
Morris Heights_b2813399-3076-4cb0-b99a-5f7691259ddf,"Eighteen years of living in the South Bronx has been extremely difficult as I have matured in this area. It has improved with crime rates, yet there are many crimes we do not find out about until told by a neighbor or seen on the news. There have been many cases of robbery and rape in my area with girls around my age. Many suicides have also been committed in the area, yet as I said before we do not find out until heard from someone else. The area is filled with mostly Hispanic and Black cultures although now, a few Caucasians have been moving in lately, due to cheaper housing. Sanitation is very poor I must say, but then again I basically was born in this area so I am now accustomed to all the dangers around my family and I."
Morris Heights_73a1faab-b31c-413d-943d-eb453b8dd93a,"Everything its pretty cleaned and well maintained."

No jobs

Crime is high"
Morris Heights_e3252566-c826-479a-ad11-c3b2f1cc5d39,"The area is typically safe if you keep to you self and stay aware of your surroundings. Although, the two times I called the police, they were slow to respond. I see police cars constantly cruising around and occasionally I'll see them near the train stations."
Morris Heights_913eee64-910d-4724-87bd-bc05276c36f4,"My parents moved here when I was a child and the neighborhood has greatly improved since then. The area is very convenient as supermarkets, clothing stores and multiple modes of transportation, schools and etc are extremely available. Its not the worse place to live but I'd prefer to live in Manhattan again."
Morris Heights_364d825f-792e-40bd-967d-8283e89ec5cc,"Their are people who have been living here for over 50 years that are still here so I guess it a good community."

Morris Heights_5c3d184a-8289-4832-ac73-24b0ee7b7870,"It's a pretty close community almost every knows you or has heard of you. Drugs are on the rise here and people aren't that interested in going to college or moving out of this neighborhood"
Morris Heights_b1da077b-aebe-485e-8ed7-b0fb7b960a35,"Its cool, its mostly alot of houses."
Morris Heights_6ffe718b-088f-4c2e-a6cd-065f707ccaca,"The area anywhere I live can benefit from having more family oriented  and educational programs. In addition, more higher paying jobs should be available to the residents. So that they could afford to pay for the rising rent prices that are already to high."

Morris Heights_0c28f1ac-b316-4685-960a-8d69fb726d79,"Crime is not super bad like saying nobody can walk on the streets, but people still have to be careful and keep their guard up. They should be more alert and prepared for anything."
Morris Heights_9aa86b56-7b16-4ae5-a8e9-acf57228f4aa,"There are a lot of businesses around here. There are businesses from restaurants to laundromats"
Morris Heights_6f5eb9bd-adfe-4228-b780-5aea9846401f,"Since I live in an apartment building, there aren't really any actual houses nearby. The only ones that are near would be about 3 blocks away."
Morris Heights_0bcdcc83-72e2-422e-9076-e0582c1f002a,"The food around here is not the best, but it's not the worst. However, there are some varieties. It's very easy to find a place that might have something your craving like pizza, or chinese, or even halal food."
Morris Heights_b237e5f4-2ff8-437d-a484-2d475fdd5821,"There's really not that many job opportunities unless someone was looking for a minimum wage job. Other than that it's very hard to get a job around here."
Morris Heights_23510582-dcb1-4cda-be3a-fb26bb0ff340,"Halel is mostly the food I buy due to it being spicy."

In this living environment you have to work hard to get out of the living situation. You have to go else where to find great opportunities for yourself."

Morris Heights_b3f6832d-6388-4450-99d9-10a77219337e,"We have a McDonald;s right around the corner from my house. We also have a great little pizza shop that I love. My brother and I order from there as much as possible. But the best part is going down to the Yankee Stadium Hard Rock Cafe for some good burgers. There is a great flower shop around my house where I got both my prom corsage and one for my friend. The service there is great and they also have the option of spray painting the flower(s) you choose to your liking. Which is great when you want a funky color. I went to order my corsage and boutonniere the morning of my prom. It was done by time I got my hair done which was perfect and very convenient."

Morris Heights_aedc6559-253c-4402-ad7c-09667b3128fb,"By car it's very convenient, but the 4/B&D lines are near and local buses like the Bx36, Bx3, Bx11, Bx35, Bx13 can take you across to Manhattan to the 1 train and other local buses."
Morris Heights_a032d77c-3a85-4671-9274-29c8d731b235,"The food quality in this area is actually great. The McDonald's food service is good quality and as well as the Dunkin Donuts located around the area as well."

Morris Park_fd79a65a-c94b-4a4b-959a-74afbaf6f087,"The area is okay. Its decent and safe for children and etc. However the community is competitive and they are bitter to each other with except to a few men and women who are genuinely nice. Depending who moves in the building won't qiuite matter since we are usually either openly kind or openly bitter towards one another."
Morris Park_2eca10dd-8e56-4bca-adc6-7981fe74dd95,"There is an okay sense of community. Perhaps it's because I am a minority in my neighborhood that I don't feel as inclined towards the community. There are many friendly people and I often find myself speaking to a stranger now and then."
Morris Park_ab8cb841-7741-4167-a3d8-a86501032302,"The area is great in terms of safety and is, in my opinion, one of the safer neighborhoods in the Bronx.

Morris Park_7986451d-d225-4f33-9cc7-7417c2dfeaa4,"It's quite convenient living near the main street so most of the stores are easy to get to when I need something. There is a grocery store, Deli, library, bakery, diner, dollar store, pharmacy, all in walking distance from each other. The new hardware store is a great addition to the neighborhood as well and lets me get supplies less common to other stores in the area."
Morris Park_35f4e558-f1fa-40b0-9a5d-dda500ab4ac9,"Police take a while to show up when called a couple of times due to domestic violence issues in the apartment below me, fire stations are close by."

But the interesting thing is that it always happens in two particular areas of The Bronx. If we can just have more law enforcement in that part, then it would get a lot better."
Morrisania_e34bb103-f39b-41ee-9b7d-64e1b6b0142e,"I have been living in this area all my life so the overall experience for me is nothing but great memories and development. This will always be the heart of New York to me besides Manhattan. The Bronx goes unnoticed because everyone think the society is nothing but aggravated and cold hearted people, but the truth is this area was once in the dumps. The locals grew up in poverty when this area was down and dirty, when businesses were up and running and streets were cleaned of litter and crime, it became a better place for the most part. You have to learn to survive here, and I wouldn't want to have been born and raised in any other place than here. It molded me into someone strong, be alert at all times, and always ready for anything."

Morrisania_3a2084cb-b4ff-4566-8b6a-ef6496a88b14,"Mostly gang violence. A few months back there was a shooting in the middle of a busy intersection, during school dismissal hours."

However , my family and I have been through a lot where we currently live right now . When we first move , a boy touched my behind and I reported him. Another guy followed my older sister to the last floor , where our apartment is . Almost 4 years ago , a woman set her dad's apartment on fire and we almost died . We have seen people fighting , shooting , people getting arrested, gangs members , etc . My mom used to work at the restaurant that was open 3 years ago below our building , she worked a alot and got paid so little. Further more , we had accidents with rats , water leaking , etc in our apartment . By the grace of God , we are alive."

Morrisania_3ebc9bee-1e0c-4a0c-a942-d12db405401e,"There has been lots of police to watch over lately.I think we still need improvement but you can not  count on the government to change the neighborhood without people of the community willing to change there ways first."

Besides a neighborhood we are all a family, living in a community that cares and looks after each other. Many things have changed around my neighborhood for the best. Many new local restaurants are being opened, re-creating parks, and it is not becoming a major center of transportation. With the highway to Manhattan, Brooklyn and New Jersey being really close."

The policy department is doing a great job cleaning up the streets of much of it's gang activity; however, there is a lot to be done about it."
Mott Haven_1cdf46b8-f7ba-493f-9b6c-77f0a1c2b313,"I live in the South Bronx, a very poor, low socioeconomic neighborhood. Many young children are peer pressured into joining gangs, peer pressured into using drugs, and many other negative activities. It is a very lively neighborhood at times, but there are many moments where there are violent events such as shootings, robberies, and fighting that bring the overall vibes of the community down."

We have playgrounds and community center nearby in which keeps the children busy and entertained which is a great way to keep them out of any trouble. The area is pretty clean and earthy, there are plenty of trees and plants around. Everyone tries their best to keep the area clean and odor free. Overall, i would recommend the area to anyone looking for a good living environment that is both clean and danger free."

There are robberies, shootings, molestation, and unpleasant encounters, but police come around for ticketing not for crime watch. My concern is the recent liquor store built near the rehab center. Makes no sense."
Mount Eden_262efee2-0a24-492d-a390-abe169f860cc,"Summer is hot! but nice. Sometimes, there are serious heat waves, and it's best to stay inside with the AC. But usually afterward, there's a problem btwn Con ed and residents because of overcharged bills. Spring is nice as well. Not too much rain, and it's a busy city, so it doesn't really slow things down, except people are more cautious driving buses and cars. Winters can be disrespectfully cold and sometimes pleasant. Snow doesn't have to appear for it to be super frigid--at these times, it's as quiet as a suburb and the streets are as vacant as school on saturday. Autumn is also nice. In autumn my wardrobe can range from light sweater to a heavier jacket to an ankle length coat. I like switching up, so it's nice to me, especially when shopping...you just end up buying an entire store haha"

Mount Eden_8c2e7eb1-72ad-4cac-a8bc-aebb64218864,"I would not choose to live here again. I haven't been everywhere in the country. I may have visited some places, or stopped in and near some places, but I haven't lived in them to really compare.

Mount Eden_d05658ad-8ce8-4298-9f7e-9b8244d36b79,"There are no community events that I know of or heard of. The residents have changed over the years; When my family first moved to the neighborhood, it was beautiful and clean. Many of my good neighbors for 5 years moved out, or past away and others moved in of course, altering the positive vibes of the building and neighborhood. It's not completely terrible though. Some of my old neighbors remain pleasant. The only sense of community that I felt was when I tutored one of neighbors kids and spent time with their family (some who live upstairs)."
Mount Eden_df570bde-99ba-4c83-a3c9-9bf7c67762df,"Last time someone was stuck in the elevator, it took a little over 30 minutes for them to come and the officer I spoke was extremely rude."

Mount Hope_edd86ee9-ea61-4e99-a3e7-067c4920f14c,"this area is not that good in the sense that there is violence sometimes. There are a few illegal trafficking points around but other than that it is and okay area because they don not mess with normal people and by normal people i mean those who are not engaged in any illegal matters."

Mount Hope_795b3a1e-008a-47b5-babb-833b5ecd0bef,"This is not the best area in the bronx but I would say transportation and other facilities are very accessible like supermarkets, post offices and 99 cent stores. I don't plan on staying here too long because I want a house one day and not in this area"

Murray Hill_5588d55c-5e23-4eea-a2f7-97babe6f04c8,"I moved to Murray Hill after living in the East Village, a different neighborhood in downtown New York, for the past four years. Morning to Murray Hill was a little bit of a culture shock. I was very used to artsy vibe of East Village, constantly pulsating and always entertaining -  performers in Union Square and Tompkins Square Park, unique stores, vibrant nightlife, etc. It is also a very student-populated area due to the proximity to NYU. Murray Hill is very much a young professional's neighborhood, filled with 20-30 something year olds who moved here after college (such as myself). The neighborhood is filled with less quirky characters and a lot more happy hour specials. Though a tad more serious and toned down than the downtown neighborhoods, there is nevertheless a good selection of restaurants and bars, and not as quiet at night as areas like the Financial District or Upper East Side."
Murray Hill_ba7dc89e-7555-4bd2-b8e9-8cf2de286f6c,"Murray Hill neighborhood is filled with people from different cultures, businesses, and living complexes. There's always something to do or somewhere to go such as the grocery store, pizza store, newspaper stand, restaurants, clothing boutique, pharmacy, movie theater, and libraries. Murray Hill feels safe because there’s a sense of community, closure, and security. The mixture of locals, commuters, and tourists enhances the diversity in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is often quiet, but once it hits rush hour during the afternoon and at nighttime, that’s when the streets become the busiest. From all 5 boroughs, I’m glad I chose to live in such a welcoming place."

Murray Hill_8f047f87-1b2b-4be9-800f-5d725767cd4d,"There is a little bit from all four seasons here. The changes in weather can be felt as the months go by. There has been a small number of minor natural disasters that effected city life and operations."
Murray Hill_c6f21558-ec66-4e78-806d-6a8dc651710e,"There are many chain stores and restaurants owned by bigger companies. In the quieter streets the are some local businesses."
Murray Hill_992317a9-6777-49e1-8b82-0d3329efe382,"The only times when sirens run through the streets are when EMTs and fire trucks pass or when there is a car accident."
Murray Hill_6e95d9dd-5ade-4a4e-9e97-9afe3401417c,"The neighborhood is relatively peaceful. There are rarely any incidents in the area. There are two grocery stores with in a two block radius. There are also enough restaurants and gyms. The city bus runs frequently on their route. The cost of housing may be a little high. There are no vacant properties for long periods of time."
New Brighton_eee0af9c-4dc6-4b23-ae40-42227f569f93,"My neighborhood is known to be quite violent but thats only relative to certain parts of the neighborhood. You could walk a few blocks from my house and a lot of crimes could be going on, whether they involve violence, drugs or criminal sexual acts. But for the most part everything is kept very secretive. You wouldn't know something was going on unless people talk, that in itself has it's ups and downs. My only concern is that I personally feel like a target walking around at times, not to the civilians but to law enforcement. The only reason I feel like a target is because i'm a woman of african american descent."
New Brighton_0edd7646-6946-4d13-8380-28c9d979fd08,"It's not a bad place to live but just like anywhere in NYC I get tired of it fast. There's a lot that comes with the ideal of living in NYC and I do not understand the excitement of living here, but that may be because I have lived here all my life. NYC is the place to visit but the cost of living is a bit much for the size of home you'll get here. The diversity of the city is appreciated. The general atmosphere can be quite overwhelming and wild at times. I personally wouldn't live here again. Although I am not a fan of living here, when I leave after a while I do begin to appreciate it. I see things not changing much in the future."
New Brighton_ed551072-5550-41d1-8132-f1d5f5c96de9,"Having the City (Manhattan) so close to where i live is so convienent. And all of the opportunities the a presented to me just because i live here is a plus. NYC is a great places to live and i wouldn't rather live anywhere else."

New Brighton_eaa4f601-7fee-444d-a42d-e06ce074af8a,"HANDFUL OF JOBS OPEN BUT MOST ARE LOW WAGE, FAST FOOD, LOCAL RESTAURANTS, NOTHING THAT PAYS WELL ENOUGH TO COVER LIVING EXPENSES."

New Springville_30bc5c09-08b7-4292-b708-fec6e520cb59,"The crime in my community is little to none. Compared to other sectors of Staten Island this place is almost too quiet. Of course there are robberies here and there but the percentage of dangerous crime such as, murder and kidnapping is nowhere to be found here. Walking outside at night is something that people around my neighborhood don't have to think twice to do. The only reason alarms are necessary are for robberies that happen once in a blue moon. However if there ever was any suspicious activity then theres always someone who will report it immediately."
New Springville_175227c4-36e5-4e9f-b9d8-dc75bdd73cec,"Theres an overall sense of calmness that prevails within the community. The houses are well-kept and maintained to almost perfection. The small parks that encompass the neighborhood are considered little havens to escape any of the problems you may have in the privacy of your own home. Restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, and any other accommodations that we may need are a 10 minute bus drive, or car ride away. This would be a delightful place to raise your children, there are parks that surround the neighborhood,and many other children friendly places which include swimming pools and  trampoline places. Another aspect of my community that makes me certain that this place will thrive in the future is nature, there's a trail thats within walking distance and a golf course that spans around the community. Its a perfect combinations of nature and suburbia that not many places tend to have."

New Springville_f678a1b5-a65e-4ee3-87ee-730b57efb2b2,"I would say this is the best area of Staten Island businesses, as the Mall is here and it is basically the hub of the island. Apart from that, there are several bodegas and small businesses such as salons and laundromats. There are also large scale supermarkets like Costco and Target in this area, so it stays quite busy."
New Springville_37607f47-8a9b-48b1-b388-0843eed79ded,"There have only been two major crimes that I can remember in this area, and I have been living in the New Springville neighborhood of Staten Island for over 16years. You get good and bad people everywhere, but I would say this neighborhood has some of the best people, who go about their day and don't cause trouble."

North Riverdale_643e8926-ec45-4517-b8f5-39d285bbdf34,"I believe that the crime and safety rate isn't that bad in my area, although it is getting worse. Recently I have heard stories about break-ins and there was a stabbing not to far away. Usually when you here a crime occur, which is quite rare, it's something like vandalism or breaking-in. Like I said before though, there is an increasing number of more dramatic and serious crimes occurring."
North Riverdale_d342d48a-89b9-4dbf-98b1-73a41412d60d,"The atmosphere is very welcoming. The people in this town are diverse, but we share similar goals. Many people share similar customs and most of us have gone to school with each other since we were little. There is an overall closeness that the town has to offer. i would definitely choose to live here again. We are a close distance to the city and the subway and metro north are in walking distance. This is nice because you can always hop on a train to the city to change things up. The restaurants and stores are in walking distance as well which is very convenient."

Norwood_1dd300dd-a69f-4cce-b082-4600b65dcfcc,"Norwood is an amazing and upcoming neighborhood in the Bronx! You will find everything in Norwood to satisfy you. Whether it's the delicious quesadillas from New Star Cafe or the extra cheesy pizza from Sal's Pizza, everyone who comes to Norwood understands that there is always something to eat! Adding on, we have an amazing park (Oval Park) where everyone can find something to do. From chess tables, to a football field to a cute dog park - we are all always active at Oval Park! Come visit Norwood and you definitely will not be disappointed."
Norwood_fc7c77c1-5e63-4511-a52d-14a74698a1e1,"Norwood is a very interesting place to live in since it is nestled within a large hospital, a cemetery, a police headquarters and is only a few miles away from the world famous Bronx Zoo. I've lived here for most of my life and I can assure you that this place is a must see if you are visiting New York. It's like the prime example of a suburb right outside the bustling city!"

Norwood_60ffe6a2-cb10-4ac9-a75e-39c2421d0e16,"I like how my neighborhood  has lots of plants. its very green giving it that fresh vibe. You feel like you're outside the city but only 30 minutes away from Manhattan. I like how the apartments are scattered. Also we have a small backyard where we could park our bike, put up clothes on a hanger, play soccer and other things."
Norwood_876379d1-313b-4558-8542-35f8bdb4e872,"The area is okay , It really could be better . I feel like there should be more police officers around here watching what goes on around here , I've noticed some drug dealing and my brother Is now in rehab because of the drugs he bought around this area , they got him into that and now he's been gone for almost a year . but besides that I feel that the area is fine , my building is nice and kept clean . The streets are always kept clean , the 4 and B and D train are very close , makes traveling easier . there's also many busses that go pretty much everywhere in the Bronx and there's two busses that make commuting to Manhattan very easy . There's a super market two blocks away and a candy store down the block . Good food places a couple blocks away in Mosholu parkway so if I ever want to eat out I can easily walk over there"
Norwood_66bc06e9-d453-440d-b045-af38e7158517,"This area serves two very large hospitals along with many schools - pubic, parochial and for the hospital.

Norwood_35fba6c2-1f14-44c3-b441-646b8b8dc884,"I would choose to live here again because we're surrounded by so many parks instead of buildings and people.

If I had to do it again, I would still like this area because there are so many playgrounds with and without water to play in which was fun growing up."
Norwood_04d7a38a-57be-4cec-aa77-3dc69a548656,"Nothing too crazy happens. In experience people only get into problems when they get in other peoples business. Focus on you and do what you have to do and there shouldn't be a problem."

Norwood_fc73c3ff-aba0-451e-bd6a-d49025bd4be8,"I personally like my location, in New York nothing is too far away. It is easy to access Manhattan from here. A thirty-five minute train ride to Central Park. I am located on the boarder of Yonkers and The Bronx. Therefore, it is easy for me to access a more suburban scene. I can take a bus, or hop on the Metro North to access upstate New York. This location is surrounded by parks. There is a lot of foliage, that you see change ass the seasons pass. It is a fairly quiet location. Our neighbors across the street are squirrels, different kinds of finches and the occasional skunk. A couple blocks down is the commercial area that can get congested with people in the after noon. There are a couple schools around as well, so around three o'clock it can get a bit hectic between the crowd from the commercial area and the kids from the schools. The crowd dies down around four thirty. Not to many cars pass by either. At that point of the day and after, all you really hear is the light chirping of the birds, and the breeze rattling through the leaves."

Olinville_ee6b601a-14bb-4aee-b986-ea6054c74d29,"I live with my mom in an apartment with two rooms and we pay a pretty cheap rent compared to manhattan prices for 2 bedrooms. However, that's pretty much what I like besides having the subway so close and having access to both the red and green lines. However, the area is mostly Jamaican and I really stand out but the neighbors are very nice and keep to themselves for the most part. Regarding convenience, I like that there's a 24-hour laundromat that never ever closes down even in the holidays and a mini market. However, I dislike how far away I live from the city and it takes me an hour to get anywhere which is why I've arrived late to my 9am classes a few times unless I wake up at 5am. But I can't complain, I love my space, I love my apartment and wouldn't trade it for anything right now. Though I can't wait to start making substantial money to move into a better area."

Its quite and have very friendly people around. The most current problem in my area is the constructions going on around me. The roads as of now are very bumpy and uneven. Instead of paving it properly its jagged. It is a up coming area but the constructions are the worst."

The neighborhood was mainly white and conservative but as the economy recovered, people of all creed, race and ethnicity has moved in and the residents are very welcoming. The neighborhood now considers itself a 'blue' neighborhood and a Democrat politician literally lives around the block from my house in a modest 2 floor home. The rent is surprisingly cheap for a beautiful part of Queens, NY. My mother worked two full time jobs to moved us out of East New York (not a great neighborhood) to Ozone Park and everything from the scenery to the smell in the air on a warm spring day if different. I was given a chance at a new life and all we did was move 20 minutes away. Thank you Ozone Park!"

The streets are patrolled with cops because of recent altercations but there are young stars here. being that this is the place the Wu tang clan originated, all of these young adolescents are just jolting with talent and ideas and perspective, so I cant say that the neighborhood is ALL bad.

On the other hand,  spring and summer seasons are the opposite of winter and fall seasons. During spring season, its in between hot and cold like 47 and 55, but it s really hot during the summer, like 75 and 90. this is the reason why most people consider spring season as the best season out of the four.

Parkchester_ab2f8b6a-836f-4bb6-9eb8-c03ba2faa2e6,"Housing is just like most other Bronx apartments."

Parkchester_91d220c6-1527-4c66-9a8f-4c21b4d9e27d,"Parkchester is a pretty safe place. Occasionally you will have your hold ups in building lobbies, but there is security around the area that responds quick to any incidents of that sort. There is surveillance in the buildings. As mentioned before, you do have your occasional incidents, but we are in New York . We have to be realistic."
Parkchester_fbaabddb-f65f-41f4-8192-20d7c5ec0fdf,"Parkchester is a beautiful place that is full of diversity. There is a little bit of everything in Parkchester. There is crime , but we are in New York. There are many stores and fast foods places all around the area. Due to the fact that there are so many stores ,( Macy's, Marshall's, New York & Company etc.) , there is a lot of traffic during the holidays. Parking can be tough sometimes. The perks of living in Parkchester is that you have the 6 train very close to you as well as many buses like the BX22 ."
Parkchester_75c374ff-3420-426f-a9b6-ae6901df506e,"good safety police are always around if needed. they have done a great job on cleaning up crime. people in the area are able to walk at night now and take there kids to the park again. safety is great here."

Parkchester_38d885e4-3a1a-450a-8b96-8be708bf16f7,"I would say my area is okay for the simple fact that I am used to living here. I don't know too many people around my neighborhood except adults and neighbors whom I love. Overall, I know when I get the chance I would move and not come back."

Parkchester_4a47367b-890f-449c-9fa5-11818c5fd88d,"While living here used to be great for me, I thrive to seek out betterment and a more exciting place to live. This area is meant for big families who have too many elementary children to handle or for senior citizens who have retired. This is not the place to live for anyone in between."
Parkchester_f120256f-69a7-4314-a911-af49c2dc56d1,"It is hard to attain a job in this neighborhood if you do not know someone in the system."

Parkchester_a5de7eb4-fcb7-49f6-8163-d06e51a6c2c4,"Mnay fast food, restaurants to choose from, if your hungry at night, there's always a deli open, somewhere there's even a pizza place open."
Parkchester_46ea6f59-133c-4c57-b880-302f5ce1a5d5,"There's a lot of place in the neighborhood where people can start off. There are many restaurants and small businesses."
Parkchester_cadf31ed-bae6-4af7-ac02-cc692002ec24,"It's very convienient, there's even a Macy's down the block from my house."
Parkchester_e3407612-eba0-4f2d-9f4f-f7589898ea03,"Fast-food chains, an Applebee's, a mediocre diner and a few good Latin restaurants are in this neighborhood. The food choices could be better."
Parkchester_a0340856-72fd-4a9e-b9ca-13e837cd79c1,"It's a small neighborhood, there are stores and restaurants and places that hire but it's not the greatest job market by any means."
Parkchester_c008e251-aee5-4a8e-bda2-04623a5e80ec,"Crime fluctuates here. There are security guards constantly prowling the area lately, though."
Parkchester_c7ec9fd5-29ee-4276-b411-c04207986c65,"The 6 train and several different bus lines run through this area. There's a Manhattan express bus and a bus that stops by the 2 & 5 trains."
Parkchester_04c61573-7778-49d1-bc83-c01c8beb41d0,"For a neighborhood in the Bronx there are a lot of quality retail stores and at least one of the supermarkets provides organic/vegan/vegetarian food options. There is also a fairly large Asian food market nearby that stocks a lot of food that tends to be unavailable in many Bronx neighborhoods."

Parkchester_9606f627-7be9-4a67-80d8-6a4557d79428,"For the most part every business is clean, but as for a variety of stores there's not much of a variety other than retail."
Parkchester_d398a104-4ea1-4544-9e6f-7b3e81e31af7,"We have our own security unit that patrols and works alongside of the police. They do a great job overall."
Parkchester_a781988e-4f5c-4660-abbe-377713c407d7,"The majority of jobs available in this area only consist of retail. Retail stores are the predominant source of jobs. so there are no other places to find another type of job in this area."

Parkchester_1328904e-c915-45a1-9f53-6c2c196680f3,"We have all four seasons but the weather is unpredictable.Natural disasters are non-existence. As far as my wardrobe goes have a think coat and sweaters."
Parkchester_650f539b-1783-4887-b424-4cd326c7836a,"There are many beautiful homes. However, owning a home is quite expensive due property tax; water/gas/electricity and other expenses. Some abandoned houses here and there. Some blocks have gangs activities and some don't. Most neighborhood are quiet."
Parkchester_d1979e64-3756-4301-9034-efba886882e5,"The crime rate in this area goes up and down but not really dangerous. People in the neighborhood look out for each other. Never got robbed in my 30 years here."
Parkchester_5ac92836-5283-4ad2-ba38-ef7cc111008b,"This area is mostly made up of food service related jobs. They are under paid and don't get raises. Major of neighbors work else where."
Parkchester_3af717bd-515a-4bbd-baac-41d796db6f97,"I live in a residential. Businesses around my area are a mixture of moms-and-pops and major retailers. Product availability is either limited or sold in other far away neighbors."
Parkchester_5e6c46c1-3991-4b1d-86f0-976ec5044eb9,"There is nothing I am short of, but they may be a few. The area is great and I get what I need."
Parkchester_c6decced-cae1-4ca2-9de9-57476d6da197,"So far, everything is good. Not much of crimes occurred in this area."
Parkchester_5abff7a6-e7d4-45ac-8282-c4b1fb1375ab,"The employment in this area is not that great. It is not as easy as it seems to get a job, most people need a certificate in order to get a well paying job."
Parkchester_3909bd0f-e790-455c-9fcc-fdc2849a4229,"I enjoy where I live. There's not much of a hassle , and I wouldn't mind living here again or even moving out"
Parkchester_44c64c3f-d648-4eeb-9481-dba386e799ff,"We've seen our fair share of icy or slippery road, but I honestly can't complain about the weather."
Parkchester_0e51b495-d6c3-4739-989c-b81ef82e5998,"We have one large outdoor performance space in the heart of the neighborhood, but I honestly only remember only members of the community performing there, no big name acts as far as I know."
Parkchester_45e3cdcc-81e0-4db1-b2e4-c295338d7114,"The neighborhood is incredibly diverse, with people of every creed and color inhabiting the homes. People are generally friendly and accomodating."
Parkchester_f3aa2b09-d180-4e71-9b97-c25d5b2a65c5,"There was a gym recently built and I think that has pushed people in the neighborhood to be more active. Before that, with the limited fast food options, people were content eating poorly and not working out. Biking is also prohibited in the area. People have began running through the parks though, so health is on the rise."
Parkchester_766751db-152a-4a6c-9010-d8dcd4330686,"Again, this is New York, more specifically the Bronx, so yes crime happens and we are concerned about safety. I usually don't find myself out too late, so I don't have much trouble with that but there are usually police patrolling the neighborhood and with the exception of a few robberies and assaults there has not been significant crime in the area over my stay."
Parkchester_3b6aa3e3-6b5d-4b7e-b2d2-2bc9cac6c56d,"Honestly, I only remember ever hearing from our local representatives when an election was coming up. Then they were suddenly out in the streets asking for votes. I haven't heard of any substantial changes or even promised of change ever being proposed."
Parkchester_f763c483-d7de-4a15-8da8-08c1cf144c6d,"With the Cross Bronx Expressway right there, it's not hard to get around by driving. We are also close to the GW Bridge. This is also NY, so great train and bus transportation. I've only driven to the airports though, since they are far out in Queens."
Parkchester_e87cea03-bfa8-47cb-83f8-3f2b6ec9065d,"With limited retail options, there were really only a few positions available for people to work as servers or cashiers. Being young and just entering the job market as an intern in most cases, I've only worked in the city, which makes sense since more jobs are there."
Parkchester_d9854af8-71be-457c-9ecf-6486fc1b480e,"The houses are too expensive for the condition and quality they come in, but that is more of a result of it being New York real estate rather than a reflection of the neighborhood itself. The housing wasn't terrible, but things definitely needed updating and a fresh coat of paint. South side of Parkchester is rumored to be safer, but I'm not sure."
Parkchester_1b1903da-5a18-4a8e-8820-6bc58df57e78,"There is really no nightlife with the exception of one creepy bar by the train station, otherwise the food options you had was an Applebee's or Popeyes or Burger King. There is also a diner, but it is way overpriced. We ended up eating there more often than not since the other options were scarce."
Parkchester_ed6e1317-bced-4a86-876b-a4335340b1f9,"Besides eating out with family and friends, I could really almost always find whatever I needed in our very own neighborhood. We even had our own movie theater up until recently, but with a large department store, plenty of salons, laundromats, and convenience stores, you never went without in our neighborhood."
Parkchester_186ed73b-354c-4622-902b-626e64e5b0b5,"Inevitably New York's characteristic gentrification will hit the Bronx, for better or for worse, and the value of homes and businesses in the area will increase. Many families live here so the neighborhood has a family feel, but it is still the Bronx and while it was not unpleasant living there, I would rather live elsewhere."
Parkchester_fc04b807-8e7a-42db-9bca-60928b3d013b,"The feeling of community had increased towards the end of my time in the neighborhood, with more after school programs available for children and even a community organized fresh farm stand that brought fresh produce to the neighborhood. People within buildings tend to keep to themselves besides among other family. People tend to stay for a long time because people see Parkchester as an oasis in the Bronx, being relatively safe, clean, and affordable."
Parkchester_8807b82d-1451-4a43-b4ff-f7aaf0f1c6cf,"During the winter, the neighborhood maintenance workers could do a much better job about shoveling the snow.  In the spring, summer, and fall, things are fine."
Parkchester_fda31166-4a37-418d-b31a-1fd001d36b0f,"There isn't really a lot of crime in may area at all.  But there is a lot of opportunity for something to happen due to the lack of proper safety here.  There could be way more street lights in this area.  A lot of people work late and overnight jobs, and they should feel safe leaving out to work and coming home to their families."
Parkchester_85d74d3e-005c-4683-a5f1-8a1df90d9be6,"There are a lot of neighborhood events that take place here, but this isn't really a main tourist attraction."
Parkchester_f7f7e6fb-3c9a-439a-852d-f11895f39a29,"The reactions of the NYPD could be much much better.  I made a call to them a couple weeks ago, and they actually never showed up to the scene.  People in my neighborhood don't really care for or trust the police.  It's just a lot of corrupt and negative stories we hear about them and it doesn't make us feel safe."
Parkchester_873fb8bb-cb6f-4caa-a120-8dfb0a2a9410,"A lot of the people in this area have been here for a very long time.  They've raised their kids and grandkids here.  The sense of community family is very strong.  Everyone kind of knows each other or knows a family member of their neighbors.  This isn't really a pet friendly neighborhood because they aren't allowed, but almost everyone has a pet and they take great care of  them."
Parkchester_2ab6e92b-0c62-45f7-99ec-da05d29bd82d,"There are mostly ma and pa stores in the area, but they are great.  The quality and service are both really good.  I would definitely recommend them to everyone who comes to this area.  From corner stores to bodegas to laundrymats to pizza shops, everyone knows each other and help one another out."
Parkchester_cbd807a5-7dda-4ef8-946d-1b8e72b679b4,"The quality of the housing situations could be much much better, but everyone is pretty much comfortable with how they are living or just don't really care to change it."
Parkchester_8f49fe58-b00f-4e87-88b2-662e7f5ab976,"My neighborhood is made up of condos and the rent here is pretty high.  But everyone has what they feel is a decent job and it pays the rent and bills."
Parkchester_c9515b67-28f7-4448-9671-6c2ec1a2008c,"I live in a very diverse community.  At one point, it was an orphanage, then after that closed, it was a living community for only Whites.  Eventually this was ended and everyone was welcome to live here.  It is now a lot of different people from very different cultures and countries.  I enjoy seeing hos different everyone is but can still live around and tolerate each other and at the same time respecting one another."
Parkchester_b848e2ff-1753-45a3-a7de-7898648e466b,"There are a lot of opportunities to workout and be fit.  There are a lot of healthy places to eat.  People in this neighborhood just have to make the correct and healthy eating choices."
Parkchester_4bbe694f-346d-408c-8a49-fec2bfb73721,"The quality of the parks and outdoor areas are very great.  I am often outside enjoying it.  There aren't too many trees, which is great.  But on the other hand, there is a lot of litter that no one really seems to be too concerned about."
Parkchester_53999078-8343-438e-acf0-7d24694b1762,"If I could do everything all over, I would definitely come back here.  This was a great choice to live.  I enjoy every minute of it."
Parkchester_7fe9326a-27bc-40d4-b967-e0e5fea7419e,"The variety and quality are both really good in the area."
Parkchester_2b3d6a43-323e-4558-b183-e1e47b017ea8,"To be quite frank, I am not sure of the rate of our crime. I do not hear about crimes in my neighborhood as often as I hear about other neighborhoods. I am pretty sure crime exist, but occasionally, I guess. I see our Patrol police all the time, whether they're driving or walking the streets of our neighborhood."
Parkchester_6d2ff7f1-e24e-43ce-b76a-d63a3bbe947c,"The Housing, around my area is not bad, its actually an Okay way of living. The buildings are not all the same internally but externally, the appearance all look the similar. The cost of living, in my opinion is average. I believe the cost is similar in comparison anywhere you go. Not so many vacant or abandoned properties."
Pelham Bay_47b329a2-bc61-4ddd-82b7-74c4ca8e8bc4,"Very quiet area as well as family orientated. next to many different transportations which make traveling to work and school super easy. many amenities around the neighborhood, nail salons, hair salons, markets, pharmecies, restaurants, local stores. nightlife isn't all that as there are only two night spots to really go to (hookah lounge and bar.)"
Pelham Bay_69471527-c56e-4a93-83b8-f4d5a4424042,"I think the places are great."
Pelham Bay_c2cab2cd-163f-4494-9008-bfe017c7d77d,"People are nice but I like staying inside."
Pelham Bay_c975b034-c726-46f0-ad0a-c9060eed1d1e,"Crime is unheard of and I feel safe here."
Pelham Bay_423a1000-4a7e-48de-bfeb-fc29482f1763,"This neighborhood is a bit suburban and quite tranquil. The local public school was great but it's getting overcrowded. Minority families keep moving in and that has changed the demographics. Home values are getting more expensive"
Pelham Bay_19c6b105-6203-494c-b1d8-abf8f637e9de,"It a place where people take pride in their street block and want to keep it clean"
Pelham Bay_1c9e8096-cea0-4a71-95f2-1fc203f4b25d,"Crime isn't visible and if there is, its some type of minor violation."
Pelham Bay_c5ec618d-e6da-4d64-9edc-1ea32e2cbbfd,"I grew up in the South Bronx and this part of the Bronx where I reside now its the opposite to where I grew up and I mean better."
Pelham Bay_582979b6-0f97-4f2e-a531-0ccaf82c36d4,"I love where I live, it's calm and a bunch of friendly people live where I am. I couldn't think of living anywhere else because this area matches my personality. From where I live, I have to travel to Manhattan and the differences from how people act are insane. There is an attitude difference as well as a speed difference that I had to catch onto in order to make it to classes. I used to be so slow because my neighborhood had a calming vibe to it, but in Manhattan is just so fast I needed to adjust my speed accordingly. In any case, I'll choose my area any day and I don't see it changing much besides different stores popping up to replace old one, but too drastic."
Pelham Bay_395753c4-2a44-42b4-9f72-c7673552ad7b,"The people are generally nice but often keep to themselves. It's a good neighbor hood though. There are nearby stores although not with all the necessities. There is access to public transportation and though its not the best it gets you where you need to go."
Pelham Bay_c9ee5259-e953-446b-bf91-6d9ac887028c,"The weather is pretty decent. Sunny, cloudy, rainy. We sometimes experience harsher storms which cause trees to fall, or flooding since we're located pretty close to water."
Pelham Bay_b297860b-f41e-4364-8c87-3c6f78839d94,"Our biggest attraction is Pelham Bay Park. There is also a beach nearby.  The summers here are crowded with people barbecuing. There often isn't much parking during this time. There are also two annual street fairs in the summer.  We also attract a lot of people due to the many forms of transporting around the city from our neighborhood."
Pelham Bay_c775fb45-539e-478c-832e-7a8ef8b950b0,"No community is perfect.  There are some downsides to living here, but I love the culture and variety here. It's so easy to go out and do something. It's easy to meet new people and have a good time."
Pelham Bay_d804a6ec-e8cd-4c48-a637-852b042c917c,"There's a train station, many bus stops, and a major highway in my area.  There is a lot of pedestrian traffic during the day and the highway is usually full, but the local streets are decent and sometimes are even empty."
Pelham Bay_d2bd975d-f28b-41ae-9d81-2081f6e410be,"Most facilities are in walking distance. When there is an emergency the responding time is usually good."
Pelham Bay_23ae6872-6799-4436-8530-b170e35a5d23,"There is such a large variety of places to get food.  It would take quite a while to try everything out. There are several pizza places, chinese restaurants, and ice cream parlors. There are also bakeries, diners, and many ethnic restaurants.  I can't even count the number of delis there are."
Pelham Bay_4558c92e-ee25-4a07-83f1-11e572edd660,"We have a huge and wonderful park. It's the biggest attraction in our area. Unfortunately, the many people who come and go often leave trash where they should not.  Trash is probably the biggest concern in my neighborhood as well as the pollution that construction creates."
Pelham Bay_60528f46-56f0-4e8e-9a30-1f8e4b7d60f0,"There are jobs available.  There has been a lot of construction and new facilities made, meaning more jobs available.

It can get very cold, most people have puffy northface jackets. However, in the summer it's almost unbearable because of the humidity. There are never any natural disasters."

Pelham Gardens_9aeb9bf5-0034-46f4-8446-078a9a8c6dd5,"Like I previously said, it is a family oriented community. While there are only bike lanes inside the park, the neighborhood is not that populated where the bicyclists have to worry. There is always parking available and the level of walkability is great. There are 3 major buses right in front of my house and a couple blocks down there are 2 more. There are 3 trains accessible. the only highly congested area is right in front of house because of major intersections and because it is a corner house."

It is interactive and fun. It is a perfect location for families. However, the only reason I rate it as 'It's Bad' is because of the price. One person is $35+, which is completely ridiculous. There aren't any student fees."
Pelham Gardens_5fd6f4e5-0f3c-435f-b9e3-2b26b3c61508,"A genuine aspect of my neighborhood I admire is how accessible the local fire/police stations are. The local fire station is right around the corner of my house and the police station is 2 shorts blocks north. There are 3 huge hospitals (Jacobi, Montefiore and Albert Enstein). However, the hospitals are not up to par. The allotted waiting period is ridiculous. Not to mention the fees included despite only seeing a physician for a short amount of time. Because all these major services are near each other, its never truly quiet. As for public transportation, one bus in particular is inconsistent. I am not too familiar with local representatives/state reps/governors/etc."

There are so many different restaurants and there is basically a convenience store on every corner. I am a 10 minute walk to Macy's and to Grand Central Station.

Many people who live in Staten Island find jobs in Manhattan, that being so because Manhattan is known for having many of the high paying jobs that can support a family, and that pay better than decent money.

While there are high quality restaurants on Staten Island that are sure to fulfill your dining needs, you can also find a slew of fast food chains as well. From the conveniently placed Mcdonalds and Wendys, to the high end Five Guys, there are many fast food restaurants to be found if you're just in the mood for something quick and filling. There are also family food chains which can be found on the island, from Ihop to a simple family diner, where you can enjoy a great meal and have nice family time.

There are many stores in the mall that meet many of the shopping needs that people have. Beyond the Mall there are also a  couple of outlets where people could also shop if by chance you can't find what you're looking for in the mall. On Port Richmond Avenue, we have a Ralph's Ice stand. Ralph's Ice is a very popular spot on our little island, people love to frequent there every single day to get a quality ice, or ice cream. Down on Richmond Terrace theres an art center called Snug Harbor. Snug Harbor was once a naval base years ago, but today is known for the children's museum and for the art centers that are located there. There are also very beautiful gardens located here at Snug Harbor. A very popular tourist attraction is the Staten Island Ferry. Tourists board the Staten Island Ferry frequently, every day of the year, in order to take in the beautiful sights that lie on the River. Once on the Staten Island Ferry, you can view Governor's Island, The Statue of Liberty, the Verrazano Bridge, and the beautiful lights if you catch a Ferry at night. Staten Island has few attractions, but in reference to the famous quote, 'Seek and you shall find', If you search for interesting things in Staten Island, you WILL find them."

A lot of the people are very friendly and will say hi, good morning, how's it going, etc. as you cross paths around here.  There are some people that do nothing but loiter all day but they're nice people in general (they are mostly elderly folks and immigrants).  I've been on the Prospect Park stop of the B/Q train at all hours of the night and have never had any issues.  I was very sick one night and blacked out at the station (with a backpack full of money and personal info) and woke up to several concerned people that made sure I was ok and a couple of them even helped me walk back to my apartment.  I woke up the next day on my couch with everything still in my backpack and my apartment completely untouched.  There's also police that like to patrol that station as well as an MTA help desk so the security is always good.  The worst incident I can think of that has happened since I've lived here was one issue this past summer of some crazy guy that went down Lefferts Ave slashing tires.  The police were able to catch him and resolve the issue relatively fast that same night.  The only safety concern I wish was addressed better is that big van pseudo-bus/taxi service that rides down Flatbush Ave.  If police could patrol that strip a lot more often then pedestrians and drivers wouldn't have to fear getting run over by those vans that commit blatant traffic infractions."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_66c28257-c55f-4468-8099-a3e775e55cf2,"There's a mix of all housing types from single family homes and beautifully converted Brownstone and Italianate rowhomes to 6-story tenement buildings and newly built highrises that makes the neighborhood very diverse and lively.  There are a lot of small businesses, restaurants, and several super markets in the area that make shopping very convenient.  The only downside is that there are still some unemployed people in the area that do nothing but sit and stand outside all day everyday.  If the sidewalks were a little wider (or they simply didn't loiter everyday) then the area would be a lot more pleasant.  Also, there is this horrible big van pseudo-bus/taxi service that rides up and down Flatbush Ave that will literally run you over or out of your lane and blow through red lights with absolutely no regards for basic traffic laws.  They'll toot their weak little horn as they commit all kinds of infractions so if you're on the phone or listening to music and not paying attention then you'll be SOL if one of these vans is blazing through.  Overall, the area is still a work in progress but with all of the new construction and new businesses in the area I can only see it getting a lot better within the next 5 years."

However, if I were to walk at 3am alone, I'd be wary as there is a possibility of getting mugged. Other than that, I wouldn't worry too much. The neighborhood's prevalence of crime has dropped significantly compared to ten years ago. The police can be found patrolling the neighborhood once in a while."

Gentrification has highly affected this part of town, however, and there are a lot of new residents moving in along with sky-high condos popping up. The rent has also increased. However, I think the area isn't bad as it's only a 15 minute train ride to Manhattan. Despite Prospect Park always being crowded, it's still a walk away. I don't know if I would choose to live here again, but I do see the future of this neighborhood improving drastically, along with much more development."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_8aecf7b3-e2a0-4fd3-83d0-39c6fa3eb1f1,"Mostly residential, family owned homes with working parents and kids in school."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_c7134986-6d29-4704-900b-5debfe4d755c,"It is a residential neighborhood, mostly food shops and delis! With several trains and buses on the main street, you will always have a way home or out. The park is the haven of the neighborhood, early mornings are amazing. It will continue to be rebuilt and gentrified, but hopefully it will maintain it's charm."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_af45f155-48a5-415a-969c-7668b8a37318,"Not much you see going on day to day, but crime does happen occasionally."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_6dc15ba1-38a0-4e9f-9d30-92a7de8a684c,"Lefferts Gardens has always been a beautiful neighborhood; it's blocks are lined with brownstones and limestones  of which one cannot help and wonder, 'How much do these houses cost?' I grew up here and it saddens me to know that the racial demographic of this neighborhood will change so drastically simply because mostly white people of middle and classes beyond can afford to live here."

Prospect Lefferts Gardens_b46543d4-1844-4739-bca8-5c3bdeb85675,"I do feel safe in my neighborhood as of late which I think is one of the better changes that have occurred over the years. The question is though, has there been more police visibility because this neighborhood has had an increase in the white population here or has it increased in an actual effort to lower the crime rate in the neighborhood."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_0842fc0f-ec32-43da-9e05-9fcc3b9c1f03,"I definitely can't imagine living anywhere else, I was just sad so see how much the area has changed. So many of the other African American families in the area have been forced to move out because the rent is getting more and more expensive. Even though we've been here for a while they want to raise the rent so that they can push us out and then rent out the place for almost twice as what we pay, which is unfair."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_94be58d3-09a4-4345-89a9-71bd711199fc,"If I had the opportunity to live somewhere else, I probably wouldn't. This neighborhood is very nice and the people that live here are very friendly. if I would have to rate my experience living here from a 1-10 I would give it an 8. I would give it an 8 because the neighborhood is nice and the stores and transportation are very close by but at the same time I would like a place much quieter. Where I can have space and freedom from being around people 24/7. in the future I would see myself somewhere where it is more quiet and I can spend most of my time relaxing."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_b9a5be73-57ab-44b7-9370-af0a1132c6f6,"I love where I live. I have family, parks, schools. the Subway and overall a great quality of life."

Prospect Lefferts Gardens_454e7fbe-8eae-43eb-a81e-8c394c809074,"Not too much crime exists in this area, because I try to make it home early. But it is a pretty safe area and it is mixed with both Jews, Caucasian, and African Americans."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_b6542662-f7e2-4713-a6b4-69c9076c7946,"The weather is not a major concern of mine. I am not near the water so i don't have to worry about flooding. Also, there rarely any natural disasters in this area because there is no open land for tornadoes. There was only one bad hurricane in this area, Hurricane Sandy but other than that this area is pretty safe in terms of weather. I experience all four seasons, so I have clothing for all of the seasons."

Prospect Lefferts Gardens_1955952c-a980-4acc-8ee3-99422af65254,"The businesses in this area are okay, but they could be better. There are not enough gyms and restaurants nor entertainment in this area. However, there are many corner stores and laundromats which are convenient."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_7713640a-734f-47b8-b740-6372e823c104,"There's a large variety of housing options, from townhouses, high-rises, victorian houses, brownstones, etc. Sometimes there are abandoned properties, but this is common in Brooklyn. The worst is the threat of bed bugs. Many pre-war buildings in this neighborhood have bed bug infestations, and that is terrifying. It's not uncommon for landlords to be terrible, too, unresponsive and cheap. Luckily, my landlords are not awful, but I have had some terrible landlords in the past."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_0847ff54-59d8-4c3e-ad73-a9ed8818a29d,"There are inexpensive gyms in the neighborhood and even a yoga studio. The park offers fields, a track, and a bike lane for other exercise options. I am not sure how people in the neighborhood take care of themselves because there are many people who live here and it's hard to track their habits."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_47054ae3-11b2-43a9-8fc5-f76d7ddd1f25,"Along Prospect Park is apparently a dangerous part of Brooklyn to live in, but I live about a quarter mile from Prospect Park. I feel safe at all times. There is a constant police presence, but sometimes the police can make you feel unsafe, too. My friend was arrested in a liquor store for no reason other than he was black and he has a Muslim name. He was completely innocent, but was taken down to the precinct for 'not having a license with a birthdate on it.' In the end, in fact, the police had him confused with another black muslim man."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_c8ef1d9b-2316-400e-a997-ab7736c08a3d,"I work at climate research institute so weather is on my mind constantly. The weather varies a lot through out the year with temperatures into the hundreds and torrential down pours in the summer and negative digits in the winter with an occasional blizzard. I come from a more temperate climate so I have a hard time with the extremes and the humidity in the summer."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_262599bd-4c10-4811-aaea-c9ace0bc79dc,"My favorite dish to get is a vegetable roti from a Trinidadian restaurant. It is steps away from my apartment, and so delicious. It's a huge bargain! only six dollars for a roti that is too big for one meal. It's definitely the best. Just blocks away you can get southern soul food, pizza slices, Jamaican patties, etc."
Prospect Lefferts Gardens_227a0f52-a1c6-4bf9-a867-2af4556dde50,"Because of the range of businesses in the area, most jobs are in the service industry. Most people commute into Manhattan for work, and I am not sure what they do. New York is a huge place and my neighborhood is very diverse, so it is hard to know what people do for a living."

Queens Village_fa982354-3ffc-4cdb-97de-a1b5628d85ea,"Queens Village is a really nice neighborhood as it is very neat and quiet. I previously lived near Manhattan so moving here was a great change of scenery. 
However, along with the quietness of the neighborhood comes a sense of insecurity at night. You don't really see a lot of people walking around. Thus it feels unsafe to be out. Also there are no train stations here so you have to take buses to get to train stations or take the LIRR. 
There are also no shopping malls or quality stores. Your best bet would be to take a bus to Long Island or to go to Queens Mall. But the commute is pretty exhausting either way."
Queens Village_c9435ef7-461b-4367-a190-73db2514e04d,"It is a quiet neighborhood with alot of trees and nature. They have an assortment of corner stores  that offer different type of cultural differances."

It is a fairly safe neighborhood as long as you know where you're going and who're around. There has been an increase in police presence in Queens Village within the last few months. I wish some of the residences were much friendlier."
Queens Village_ec18472c-3fdc-424e-b0e2-e983b598dc42,"This area is not the best as subways are not conveniently located.  No malls are close by unless you ride with a car.

As of late many of the people have sold their homes and moved so we now have new residents to the block. Would love to see less fast food chains in the area ans more health conscious eating/options. More community activities and events as well as better school systems."
Queens Village_ce3088f5-8078-41f3-8fbb-eb1cce1c1878,"Queens Village is a very good and diverse community. The school system is improving. Some of the houses need to be updated and roads need to be fixed. It is very close to public transportation and to the local highways if someone is interested in traveling into New York City or into Long Island. Both locations are convenient. The neighborhood is low crime and needs more development in terms of eateries and shopping. Queens Village is also family friendly in terms of local libraries and parks as places to visit. It is also a very clean area rich in multiculturalism."

However,  I did not like the how sizes in the area because it felt congested. If the houses and land space was bigger my family would have probably stayed in Queens."

There is such a large divide in population.  If you are fortunate to live in private apartments/ homes, you more than likely pay an outrageous amount of rent.  There are some activities and night life but nothing to go crazy over.  If you live just a few blocked over in the Projects than you know the neighborhood is typically really dirty with piles of garbage everywhere and not all that safe."
Red Hook_e2b064e1-4b37-4b6a-bc31-b7dc71c7541e,"For me the crime and safety here is not a big deal because I have lived here my whole life and I am used to it.

Red Hook_911f06c8-463c-47f3-9a55-3bfe9c2603e5,"In this area, we only have access to one gym. The membership is at a good rate, but unfortunately a lot of their equipment is old and outdated. The hospitals in the area are few and lots of improvement could be made in terms of access to affordable healthcare."
Red Hook_b5031f22-00d1-491f-a74b-a026bee3e55c,"Sense of community has increased since the effects of Hurricane Sandy. Before it people were separated, and ever since people are more together and inclined to help."
Red Hook_72f417d4-6ce7-4f7a-92bc-127fdcb5416a,"The weather in this area is shaky. There are a lot of initiatives being taken to prepare for future natural disasters in the neighborhood. This is quite helpful in knowing that people care about what is taking place in the neighborhood, and are taking preventative steps to avoid potential problems."
Red Hook_bc8d3caa-e27c-4093-9868-1fb32a5fc778,"It has steadily improved over the years, but we need better options in the neighborhood."
Red Hook_6b904376-ca2a-418d-93e6-2f6ceacded14,"Not a good area for employment since there are very limited offerings. It would be great to see more organizations and workforce programs in the area."
Red Hook_beba024f-0f30-4fdb-bcb2-1f63d5b5c7d7,"Red Hook is not the place to go and buy material items. It is slowly improving with the addition of IKEA and fairway, and not surprising if it continues expanding."

Rego Park_ce169c00-3028-4b22-8f4f-559a2409224f,"The neighborhood is fine, easy access to hospital, NYPD, NYFD. Malls very close by so no need to travel far. The neighborhood is still more Russian influence you can just walk around and listen to Russian language everywhere in the streets, stores, beauty salons etc. It is not a bad thing but it does hold new comers back from learning English because they can freely communicate here in their first language. On the negative note I wish the subway station would be cleaner it's a nightmare to go downstairs and see a smelly homeless person sleeping in there for 10-15 until you train arrives."
Rego Park_525e0d8c-dfb0-4bb0-af6f-e5fee6551646,"What I like most about Rego Park is that you can walk to many local stores and restaurants. The schools are great and people are friendly."

There are a lot of attractions that are close and do not require a lot of commute time. There are multiple restaurants, super markets, delis, pharmacies, and bakeries, where everyone can enjoy. The area is safe at all times. There are speeding cameras to prevent cars from going over the speed limit, and overall a safe and fun area to live in. One change that could improve the area would be, more available jobs within the area, which could attract more people to the area, and help small businesses."

The crime rate is very low, and there are rarely any noise disturbances. As a result, the police are not very visible, but from personal experience calling 911, they respond quickly."
Rego Park_bb5a176b-6340-4276-b608-4410368fc6b4,"The general atmosphere is very calm and suburban, mostly houses with small lawns and backyards. There are people from all age ranges, and people generally are reserved and keep to themselves. There are several shopping streets that are conveniently located, and if I could do it all again, I think I would not mind living here. It is a comfortable and safe community, probably middle class or upper middle class compared to the rest of the country."

There is an abundance of  grocery stores and vegetable. There are also more elementary and middle schools than high schools here, and many of the schools serve students well when it comes to safety, community involvement and academic advancement. There isn't much of a nightlife here. The neighborhood is diverse with South Asian,Guyanese and Trinidadian people. Over the past 4-5 years various kinds of crime has increased here. There is always a police presence, especially late at night and on weekends. There are family health clinics and Jamaica Hospital that is close to the neighborhood (10-15 minutes away by car). There isn't a huge job market here besides retail jobs. This is a moderately safe neighborhood, good for families.*Bonus* You will never be without Aunties, Doubles and Roti here, as they are always in abundance."

Richmond Hill_b66f003d-aaf1-41ab-a4f8-9498e2d77d93,"I was born and raised in Richmond Hill. I would have to say, over the years I have seen a increase in diversity, which is really good. We are a community driven neighborhood, everyone on your block knows who you are, and everyone helps one another. I am very lucky to be living here. 

Now that I'm older, I see that there are so many places to go( restaurants, clubs, lounges, bars etc. ) It is also a very family friendly neighborhood, on the main avenue there are lots of after school activities to enroll children into, such as karate, dance etc. And there is a church/mosque/temple on almost every corner. Everything you need to live is walking distance from you and you still get the privacy of living in the suburbs."
Richmond Hill_9495487b-acf5-4492-b8c6-d99795813c06,"Richmond Hill is a diverse neighborhood and home to many immigrant families.

Richmond Hill_22b1cb9f-10d1-48b8-a22a-1cddea30c72d,"Richmond Hill, Queens was a great are to live until about 15 years ago.  The neighborhood has changed so much.  In the last 10 years the main avenue, Liberty Avenue has been inundated by bars and restaurants that promote drinking.  Liberty Avenue used to have stores that were family owned and it was nice to take a stroll down the avenue.  That is practically impossible now because you find drunk people, you might become assaulted, and it's so crowded.  The people in the neighborhood are of different ethnic backgrounds, but the majority are from Guyana and West Indies. Their young people are nasty and disrespectful."

The thing that i like the most is that i can go outside at anytime of the day to have a safe jog around the block.

There has been the occasional crime that has taken place, but nothing extremely violent. Besides the one or two crimes that happens its actually not that bad living here it quiet and a lot of stores are just a walk away. Preferably, I would like to move in New York City.

There are people from every background and ethnicity in my area so there are a wide range of cuisine. I would definitely like to continue living here.

Richmond Hill_62f21781-b6c6-4e49-88d1-32e0f6779703,"There aren't many safety issues in the case of transportation. There could be improvements for the bicyclists in my opinion. During the summer, kids like to ride their bikes on the streets and I think it would be safer for them and for drivers, if there were more bike lanes in the area. Traffic is hardly a major issue. Everyone has somewhere to go and we're not going to get there any faster than the next person, so we just have to be patient."
Richmond Hill_119024a0-e777-4654-80d8-cc783f009c6a,"The weather hardly ever impacts my life. In the case of natural disasters, the people of this community come together to help the neighborhood out. In the case of Hurricane Sandy, people were very effective on cleaning up the streets and broken trees. The only severe weather you would ever have to worry about here is the snow because is does get very cold and builds up quicker than you can shovel."

The schools while growing up were fantastic, and even today I see older teachers and they know who I am. Its becoming slowly another place to hang out were you can find artsy and lax places as well as very nice and tasty restaurants. Its a quaint neighborhood mostly and there are actually trees here which is great because you hardly see them in the city. I just love it here."

It is ethnically diverse, with Latino, Polish, Russian, and other residents, family-oriented, and reasonably affordable rents can be found. If you are looking to live in a quiet and livable that is also only a quick 25-30 minute commute from the center of lower Manhattan (Union Square), it's a great choice. There isn't much nightlife, restaurants are mostly fair with some hidden gems here and there, and the center of the neighborhood, Myrtle Wyckoff is a great little shopping center, where you can also find a gym (Planet Fitness), franchise cafes such as Starbucks & Dunkin Donuts, and more."
Ridgewood_d14bfaa8-27b0-41ed-b46a-9c4f45af3a45,"Ridgewood is home to friendly neighbors and small business owners that love getting to know the rest of the neighborhood. People are polite, the nearby businesses are convenient and relatively inexpensive. From Ridgewood it's easy to get anywhere in Queens, and most places in Brooklyn. The public schools, with the addition of Geraldine A. Ferraro junior high school, children in the neighborhood are being given access to a decent education. Nearby parks are clean and well maintained, as is the public library on Forest Avenue, which enables students to study, do homework, and socialize."
Ridgewood_397ee0ab-f423-4110-9bda-0e3af8d6afd4,"Great neighborhood, clean streets, caring neighbors, family oriented community. Prek-8th Grade schools are excellent.

Ridgewood_4c02dd35-2db1-4004-a6ea-67bbb491cfa7,"The atmosphere in this neighborhood is easygoing. I personally wouldn't live in this area ever again because I've gone through way too much living here my whole life.

Ridgewood_7463e1d3-8f00-4434-b91c-8493209b940f,"It's a great neighborhood that is expanding with the addition of starbucks and new bars/restaurants just a few blocks away. There is diveresity with a mixture of hispanics and eastern europeans. There is a deli on the corner of almost every block so it's easy to find a late night store open"

Ridgewood_07bc02a7-4079-41a7-b6dd-13f66d0ae8f1,"The police are not called around my neighborhood as much, and if they are, it would be for an accident or injury, not a crime. As far as I know there is rarely a crime of vandalism and break-ins."
Ridgewood_8bb5cf6c-b8df-4ece-b1d7-fcd6a64e6117,"I have enjoyed living in Ridgewood my whole life, not just because this is all I know, but because the overall sense of family in the neighborhood has been great.

The neighbors are all very friendly and many businesses are opening."
Ridgewood_c8554b5c-3397-4c78-9c57-29c959c77dfd,"The neighborhood has always been peaceful and full of friendly people. However, hipsters are starting to move in and prices are becoming more expensive. The gentrification of this great place is a concern of many of us current residents."
Ridgewood_866eda2b-4aa4-4ec7-9736-a1a8b8bcffae,"i love this neighborhood so far!! Majoirty of the people are friendly, everything is local, and overall very quiet and clean. The resturants are really good too! Some favorites i recommend: King wah, echiban, tendo sushi, and Rosas pizza. Also, fresh organic produce is being sold everyday by the one and only Valentinos! The place is packed to capacity everytime i walk in, and the best part is its affordable!There are also lots of local delis and 99 cent stores. Definately move around here!"
Ridgewood_95f8670c-b3f0-4fd3-89fd-daae047ff19d,"The houses are low quality and too expensive. In the future this area might as well be destroyed and reconstructed, most of the houses are very old and wooden. There is no sense of privacy in your house because the person next door can hear what you are saying. One of our constant visitors are cockroaches and mice. We are not allowed to use the back yard, so we don't see much grass in our daily lives. In Russia such buildings have large parks behind 'open to everyone'. I would never live here again if i had the chance to."
Ridgewood_0b696b55-eac3-4df4-90a5-d225c0052281,"Many place to apply to to get a job. For example you have Dunkin Donuts, E&J ( card store ), pizzeria, supermarket, Subways, 7-Eleven and much more."

Ridgewood_da833d32-0652-45ef-a1d2-65d335e9f45c,"There is a slew of small businesses still in my neighborhood. Gentrification hasn't messed it up completely yet, there are some large company pharmacies like Riteaid and Duane Reade, but there are also many independent ones. There is a variety of different restaurants, grocery stores, and many supermarkets as well. It's a convenient place to live."

Ridgewood_d877eb4e-17b0-4be4-b28d-9627eb1d5233,"Since the area i live in is so culturally diverse, you really get to see all different kinds of stores everywhere. From your local mom and stop bakery to your top noche local exotic restaurant.

Developers are throwing up this massive buildings which they say are affordable housing but that's bull. They are cheaply made so called 'luxury apartments'. They ruin the neighborhood and also drive the rents up which many residents (very diverse area including young & old) are finding it impossible to live here."
Ridgewood_0ee92e5b-a383-4576-b6f8-8e420a9e0cdd,"Not many quality jobs available. Especially for young adults. Even the entry level jobs are hard to get since a lot of elders need to work to make ends meet."

Riverdale_95fde82d-5897-48db-827d-a46d5f467f45,"Very charming quaint neighborhood. Suburban in nature but Central Riverdale has nice restaurants and shops like YoBurger. Great public and private schools in the area. Van Cortlandt Park is nearby, great for hiking."
Riverdale_ba16d7a1-8ac5-43a9-b2db-8c7b3f57c7d1,"Overall, it's a pretty good neighborhood. However, the diversity can be improved, most places are very expensive, and there are only two good public schools(not even high schools).  Also, it is a ghost town most of the time. Most of the people are nice, but some of the teenagers are shady. But it's a cutesy neighborhood."
Riverdale_bbd21c5e-2d96-4563-b1dd-8f8a849bc6ec,"Riverdale has been my home community for several years now. The community has become more diverse with people of different age groups and of different ethnic backgrounds. Overall the community is a friendly place to spend the time with your family."

Additionally, Riverdale is the highest point in NYC which saved it from most of wreckage of Hurricane Sandy. I enjoy the outdoors and the streets of Riverdale are really nice to walk around. Very well forested, with lot's of street trees and parks, it is a special place only a hop away from the happenings of the City."

The people are very diverse and they are usually no problems in the area. A police station is just blocks away making the community safe and calm. Van Courtland is not to far away making it very accessible to go out for a run, exercise, or play some basketball."
Riverdale_5756057a-7127-4deb-8ee1-60dfe67f61b4,"Riverdale is a quaint quiet neighborhood which is a short-distance drive from New York City. it is also accessible by express bus and by train. Although it is located on the northern part of the Bronx, it feels like you are in the suburbs. The schools are great and among the top in the city. I love going to school and living here."
Riverdale_58d8126a-dbde-47fe-a273-1ac2d44e3917,"Riverdale is a warm community where many people know each other. It is family friendly and has community events that revolve around school and church life. There are a number of great restaurants, including Becafinos and Bronx Burger House. There are a majority of Catholics and Jews. North Riverdale has many shops. The main “mall” is kosher. It is mostly a residential area with very little to do for fun. There is easy access to public transportation which will take you directly into Manhattan. Riverdale is also home to Manhattan College. Students enjoy bars in Riverdale. Van Cortlandt park is blocks from the college where you can run, walk, bike, swim, and play sports. There are also trails. Riverdale also has a horse stable where you can take lessons or just watch the horses roam. All in all, Riverdale is a beautiful and friendly place to live."
Riverdale_d5ae2d35-fc27-425b-8aca-41b963c9117a,"Riverdale is a fairly Jewish neighborhood. There are many families who live there. It is less urban than most of the rest of New York City. There are many houses and green areas. The people there are generally on the richer side and the neighborhood isn't extremely diverse but definitely has some diversity."

Riverdale_d1a154e9-ce6f-4032-9c94-1db82498e2b5,"It's great because it is an opportunity to be near great schools without living in the city where apartments are much more expensive. There is also a lot of transportation to the city."

Rockaway Park_6c7f9cbf-8f8b-4f5f-a9f0-44f641000e87,"The local businesses are reliable if anything. While there are chain companies here and there, for the most part, it's small-time stores. It's relatively easy to get what you need, between Rockaway Beach and Belle Harbor, and within half a mile radius from here. The Eastern European Deli in Belle Harbor gives access to more unique items only found in those areas, like fresh salted fish and cabbage. You'd need to leave here for other items, though, like Halal items."
Rockaway Park_6ba6b066-e7f0-4d16-aecd-93a06db3458f,"There are a number of ethnic restaurants here, and the bar is almost always occupied, no matter what time of the year it is. It's a predominantly Irish-Italian neighborhood, with some East-European culture mixed in. If you want Polish or Japanese food, go up about half a mile. Otherwise, expect to see Italian pizzerias of fair quality, Chinese food, and occasionally some Dominican food."

Rosedale_441a6df4-fc53-4263-ae5a-b335294d618b,"Safe neighborhood with a homely feel, many locals know each other by name which is rare anywhere in NYC!"
Rosedale_527a848d-dacb-489e-a42c-edfec834d2ee,"While living in Rosedale I really enjoyed the neighborhood . It is a fairly quiet neighborhood . One thing I really liked about the neighborhood is how convenient the chain of stores were . It is close by the mall so I didn't have to go out my way in case I needed something really quick and fast .The people of Rosedale are nice and it's a close knit community mainly because the kids of Rosedale all went to school together ."
Rosedale_2bd01d6c-cd59-42e4-8a6b-0c66f8ccf95b,"Rosedale is a wonderful area in Queens New York to live I have lived in Rosedale over 25 years and it's all been fine for my family and I.  The schools are great and the neighborhood is pretty quiet.  The location is in the middle of the city and Long Island, living in Rosedale you have the best of both worlds."
Rosedale_e03284a5-3a1b-4c08-8286-d46189e8a448,"My experience in my current neighborhood is very decent. I would say my surroundings are very safe and diverse for most part. The school system is suffiecient and the residents in the neighborhood are pretty helpful and polite. Everyone knows everyone here and is well aware of there surroundings and enjoys living in this pleasant neighborhood. I would definitely recommend my neighborhood for living arrangements for others interested in buying homes but no so much for the schooling I feel the school curriculum has dropped drastically from when I was attending elementary school 12 years ago. But overall I really love my neighborhood."
Rosedale_47a2d782-b000-4e17-8eaf-59b9792f7674,"Rosedale is a nice place to live and raise a family. The public schools are good. Like the retreat from the city that the neighborhood provides. However, it can be hard for individuals who commute by public transportation only."
Rosedale_44c453ca-3000-44c6-b25b-b65fb498501c,"I currently live in Rosedale and I have lived here for the majority of my life. It is a fairly quiet family orientated middle class neighborhood. The only issue with living here is the commute to Manhattan, it is sometimes an arduous task, unless you live within walking distance of the Long Island Railroad, which will cut your commute in half (30-45 minutes). However if you live where I do, and aren't always willing to walk the almost two miles, you have to deal with an one and a half hour commute via bus and subway.  As far as night life, there isn't very much just a couple bars scattered here and there, other than that there's nothing else in terms of entertainment. I will say it's very peaceful and I have enjoyed my time living in this neighborhood."
Rosedale_ec668143-0af4-41a1-929e-10624250a47a,"Really wish the schools were better. And that they offered  free pre k for kids at all school. Otherwise  the community is pretty good and has alot of things to do in Brookville park for your kids and adults as well.the police and firehouse it very close by."
Rosedale_e74ea65b-1092-4bff-894a-3731894e6b87,"The area is very pet friendly. There are quite a few family dogs in the area which I see when I walk my dog."

Rosedale_af646934-94dc-4adf-ae73-6e0307d87c1d,"Not a big fan of the general atmosphere here. Long commutes to any other part of Queens or the entire NYC for that matter, if you don't have a car. You'd never want to be at the wrong place at the wrong time 'round here. Green Acre Mall and other stores and dining places in Valley Stream being near are a plus though."
Rosedale_caf27136-2d2b-4cba-bd7b-c755cd1549ff,"There is some noticeable crime within this area"
Rosedale_cfd751de-4a6a-4e32-8b72-d5330ab20419,"Most of the stores in this area are large chain stores such as Walmart and Target."

Rosedale_81603f48-32c1-40d6-ab6e-5fae19f5a0cc,"Since I have been living here for about 23 years, I have gotten to know my neighbors for quite some time. The neighbors that I do know are quite friendly, but others in the neighborhood can be rude and uncivilized. For example, there are many dog owners in the neighborhood and they are all bad at picking up their dog's feces. There isn't much diversity culturally in the neighborhood. Most of the people around the neighborhood are of african or west indian decent. There may be one or two caucasian families. My family is probably the only Pakistani family in the neighborhood."
Rosedale_85669f92-f8fc-49f9-83a1-0cd7d83f13af,"I live near an intersection and over the years living where I do, there have been many car accidents involving cars and even people including my own siblings. There is however parking availability. There is no signs or meter parking in the neighborhood except when it comes to placed in town near pharmacys and other stores. Public transportation is available. During the weekends though traffic is a problem."
Rosedale_475cd777-3dd0-45f6-9b61-da6f7efa1134,"I would technically know much about the community in this area. There is no 'community'. No one in this area communicates as they should to make the area a better living enviornment. There aren't any events or engagements."
Rosedale_c101a8d8-c87a-48e9-82d6-8d9068125b96,"There is very few variety of stores in this neighborhood. To get things you need you would have to leave this neighborhood and go into valleystream, long island to get the things you need."
Rosedale_d898f552-56fe-4362-99f7-07ee29b2727e,"There are no healthy food restaurants in the neighborhood at all. There is one park in the neighborhood that could be better maintained. But there seems to be many of the residents of the neighborhood who are actively playing at the park."
Rosedale_6f76cddb-90a0-48bd-b786-ff7d3b8a4b17,"The houses in this area are both vacant and are occupied. Some of the vacant abandoned houses are very badly damaged and have been vacant for quite some time. The best area to reside in would be towards the long island side of Rosedale. If living more towards town, the houses are all very similar looking and house many uncivilized people."
Rosedale_394b81d6-5c81-4e7f-9214-294488a56990,"Most of the area is filled with fast food and chain restaurants. there needs to be more restaurants in the area that show the culture of the neighborhood."
Rosedale_0ecb94e2-ece2-4576-b6a6-836f419f57ac,"Its not the best area, but it isn't the worst either. The people can be ignorant, and uncivilized but in time with more police activity, maybe the area can be better in time."

However there is a high school a few blocks away from my house so sometimes the kids there are a bit rowdy. There is also an occasional crime committed e.g robbery."
Sheepshead Bay_dd3cffb2-0381-4c67-97d3-9d7bcda2cbf1,"The neighborhood overall is great. It's not too loud yet not too quiet. The crime level here is relatively low. The neighbors here are friendly. It gives off a slight suburban feel, which is good in my opinion."
Sheepshead Bay_109c160a-75f3-46a2-ba35-a30b55636292,"Some friendly people, some who look at you like you're a disgrace to the community. It's 50/50."

Sheepshead Bay_26f81c40-ab3b-4a32-aba5-88ebbc49c8cf,"It would be hard to think of any other place since I've lived here all my life. I like living here, in this urban location. I'm sure there are places better than here, but also places worse. I don't see this area changing much in the future."
Sheepshead Bay_f9359b4e-9ce2-4fe8-9430-fa4692b0de55,"It's not the worse place to live, but it isn't getting any better. A old woman was tied down and robbed in her own apartment. We have cameras in the apartment buildings (at least in mine), and I don't see the neighborhood police looking at the footage for any little piece of evidence they can find on the two guys who did it."
Sheepshead Bay_67d0ed9e-c1e6-49df-b7ef-e8c230dc30ef,"It's not that bad but it's not so great either. Everything is convenient in this neighborhood. If you need to go to a supermarket, there's three within 10 blocks."

Sheepshead Bay_19491694-d3be-462b-b25e-d0979646ea02,"Again, nothing special. Typically I go to sushi, Vietnamese food, or sometimes the diner. That's it. The food at the places is adequate. Wish I had more variety and better quality."
Sheepshead Bay_139f1d82-d373-4525-9e7f-049efdf485b7,"Very small business that don't pay a lot. Most of them are family owned and don't want to hire new people."
Sheepshead Bay_e4677fa3-eeb8-4fe3-8382-afe936a52bf5,"It's decent enough. There are no special stores--everything is just adequate. The bakeries serve decent cakes and cookies, just like other stores with their services. To get better options you have to travel to Manhattan or another part of Brooklyn. No one comes here for these stores for sure."
Sheepshead Bay_f0aad686-969e-43bd-98c3-b3763efdb0c4,"The police is a very big concern for me because they seem to care only if it is a violent crime. My mother's iPad was stolen once and I called the police and they seem to be very apathetic to it saying they could not do much because it was an iPad. It seemed odd that they did not show any concern but just wiped it off acting like it was too much of a minor deal compared to anything else."
Sheepshead Bay_06987824-7c66-47cf-bb11-4b9db2c077ab,"This place is seasonal. It has 4 great seasons which can nearly reach extremes. If it is summer then it can be extremely hot, but only for a few days. Same with winter, therefore there will be snowstorms for a few days, but never to the point of school closing."
Sheepshead Bay_c4d6b8bc-8f84-45a4-ab11-9f192e3342d8,"Since this neighborhood is kid friendly, there are just simple local pizzerias, friendly restaurants, and groceries. I prefer it to be this way because Marine Park neighborhood has always been a very family friendly area where it is far away from the night club scene."
Sheepshead Bay_e90356c6-fdcf-409f-ad83-dff6425616ae,"Employment in this area is mediocre. Many jobs around here are for teenagers because many restaurants, pizza stores, and groceries are present in this neighborhood. This neighborhood seems to lack age range, but the owners of these restaurants seem to range quite nicely. There are not a lot of doctor offices or dentists in this Marine Park area, but there are many near the neighborhood. Most people seem to be in the beauty industry therefore many nail shops and hair salons are blooming."
Sheepshead Bay_e5045761-5ad0-416f-8d38-228d191a6086,"Local businesses in the Marine Park, Brooklyn areas are very friendly. This neighborhood has many mom-and-pop shops compared to big companies. For a big brand company, a bus ride is necessary. The convenience of familiar faces and familiar routines are warm to experience in such a nice and knit neighborhood. We locally have a pizza store called 'Pronto Pizzas', along with famous restaurants such as 'Buckleys' and 'Michaels'. Access to get anything is seriously in a two block radius which in my point a fabulous location to live in."

Even innocent teenagers are lured into the stock market, home based businesses, and the drive to get Mercedes benz's! This place is probably the least tranquil, and fulfilling place in the United States. Yards are frequently cemented over in preference for luxury vehicle parking spaces. People are always in a rush, super Liberal, and unapologetic. Drivers frequently drive as if they are drunk, while crazy people yell on the top of their lungs daily, and nightly. The cops are summoned a lot, and take several hours to show up. When you have the right of way you are not allowed to park. No one uses blinkers, and everyone disposes of their trash on the asphalt, concrete, and few yards that remain. The gap between the rich and poor is tremendous with Billionaires and Poverty stricken families living less than half a mile away."

Like, you can literally hear what they say from the fourth floor; the curses, the fights, the yelling at each other. And it's not a small group, it's more than five or six in one place.

There are some trees around which makes it look great. Something I never liked about this neighborhood is that a lot of people smoke a lot. Yes, there's people like that everywhere but it's just a lot sometimes. When I get to my building, I can smell the smoke in and outside, even though it's prohibited to smoke there. During the summer, some people tend to open the fire hydrants which bothers me a lot because all of that water is going to waste.

Once you hit the means streets of New York you have to be aware of your surroundings all the time. Whether its getting off the subway heading to school, home, or the bank. I live in Washington state now and the environment lifts my spirits within itself every morning. I feel refreshed and people smile at me while walking. Not that there is not crime anywhere else, but in my home in the Bronx, there was just too many. I lived across the street from a NYPD and FDNY. I would hear the gates lifting and see the siren lights go off at least three times in a school week. My house was broken into, and no one was caught for the crime. It was a traumatizing experience.

Leaving me as a parent to feel very uncomfortable. We have had a few  home  robberies in the past year.  on the good side we have each other and family members that care and love us deeply.  I would love to see some improvements in the area but I guess that comes with time.

I'm more scared of the police than I am of the civilians. It's like there is a high crime rate and people don't really care about anybody else lives. The NYPD is terrible, not all of them BUT most of them. They take about 2hrs to come or sometimes more. It's just bad, I can't even explain it."
Springfield Gardens_dac57295-1db6-4a2f-8055-0b891ddd9db6,"The reason I rate it a 3 is because I'm all for the summer. In the winter it can get pretty cold at times. The weather here is pretty moderate though. We get all types of weather. The coldest to nearly 100 degrees in the summer time. In the winter you definitely need a big coat and in the summer you might not want to put on any clothes. The problem with the weather in the winter is that you can be VERY late for work. Due to having a car out here is VERY VERY expensive so most of us use public transportation which slows us down during the winter. Buses are almost never on schedule during the winter."
Springfield Gardens_4f57bb8d-4b29-4c08-b1a4-13ef2779b3e1,"Around my area where I live, there are a bunch of neighborhood restaurants. There's a local mall nearby ( 7 minutes) where they have Red Lobsters, TGIF, Applebee's and also Olive Garden. Then you have USA diner on the other side. I basically grew up going to USA diner. You also have a variety of Chinese, American, Caribbean, and all different type of culture foods. You can never go hungry over here. They also have quite a few clubs. My all time favorite is Clippers right down on Merrick BLVD. There's always a lot to do over here."
Springfield Gardens_173a4606-e9de-4cd4-a1b0-fb82b7fb2755,"Looking for employment in Jamaica, Queens NY is kind of challenging. Speaking on the behalf that most people working in this area have been working for quite a while. Although you can find places almost all the time like a local fast food restaurants and retail jobs that are hiring, there are often a lot of people trying to get the job along with you. It's a overcrowded area with a lot of different minorities. The fact that it's overcrowded you can only imagine how many people are going on the same interview you're going on."
Springfield Gardens_5afd2031-fe48-4a97-b502-52264956b969,"The local dry cleaners in my neighborhood fine. Your clothes gets finished on time and the service is great. But it's dirty and doesn't look appealing to the eye. There isn't much comfort in the store."

I work in Manhattan."
Springfield Gardens_91cd311a-5c9f-405b-afdc-3cbd120614fe,"My area consists of the many types of businesses you find in predominantly African neighborhoods in America today. 

Which is to say, liquor stores, restaurants that sell atrociously fatty and unhealthy foods, pawn shops, no banks, popeyes, a couple bodegas (Or corner stores as they are known to the rest of the world) and, of course, Western Union.

The businesses that often surround the living spaces of my people are often as unhealthy and constrictive as the prices that are set, and my neighborhood is no different. Though it is, by the people's design, beautiful (Who doesn't want to live in a nice place? There's someone out there who doesn't, but I haven't met them yet... As far as I know.) it is, in the end, something of an oddity. Beautiful, almost serene, yet, toxic and festering with corruption in it's own right. A spiked rose indeed, but still a rose. Forgotten or not."
Springfield Gardens_741accfc-0b97-48e9-9a56-880276e8f624,"Since Queens is the largest physical and second most populated borough, there's a LOT of space, so most people, including in my area, live in houses. And unlike the 'houses' in the more urban parts of the city, the ones in Queens and my area are actual estates, with a house that's on its own plot of land, front, back, and side yards around the house, garages, and street parking. Great place to raise a family."
Springfield Gardens_5615fa5f-ce4c-49e6-89d9-74139e9e7c6f,"This is a great place to live. It's a supremely residential area, so it's very quiet and peaceful. You don't get the noise, hustle, and bustle of city life, and it provides a great retreat from the rest of the city."
Springfield Gardens_45b8a497-1a37-4cb2-9b7d-e58788ceb766,"Being a residential area, you really need a car. There are no trains that are less than a half hour bus ride away, and no busses less than a 5min walk away. It may not seem like much, but in extreme weather, you can tell. But this area is right in front of JFK airport. Literally. Planes fly within 50ft of our house everyday. And the Belt Pkwy, North Conduit into Brooklyn, and South Conduit into Nassau County is in the area, as are the major streets of Springfield Blvd, Farmers Blvd, Guy R. Brewer Blvd, and 225th St. You can walk anywhere, though, and nothing's too far."
Springfield Gardens_1941a560-ec6b-402c-a7f4-3d1bdaada5cf,"It's good for a residential place like this. There aren't any big name stores, the only chain fast food places we have are MacDonald's, Popeye's, Subway, and Dunkin Donuts, and the latter three are new. But we have a laundromat, a Jamaican bakery, a Golden Crust, a bodega, a grocery store, a 99cent store, and a Chinese food take-out place. You can get anything and everything you need without having to go far."
Springfield Gardens_83368ca0-c72b-48d0-8cbc-f98b3e45952e,"The people in the area are primarily black, African-American, or from the Islands. You can get along with them fine, but they don't really interact with each other too much."
Springfield Gardens_cd5045b2-7d3d-4a39-84d2-9fa685155c72,"Again, this is a supremely residential area. It's not like the rest of NYC, where businesses would make money from people passing by or traveling a long way to have a special dinner. There are no big or fancy restaurants, no clubs, no parties, or any sort of nightlife safe for people coming back to their homes late. The area's full of houses, so the only eating places are fast food places including MacDonald's, Popeye's, Golden Crust, a Chinese Food place, and soon a Subway, a bodega, a mini-supermarket, and a Jamaican bakery."
Springfield Gardens_67ac1f50-5d59-4113-af63-b40c53acb814,"This is a supremely residential area. It's not like typical NYC; people come here to live here, not to pass by, not to site see, not to party, to live. There's not a whole lot of public transportation without at least a 5min walk, but you can walk to whatever and wherever you need or need to go. There's quiet a few stores around to get what you need. Not huge chain stores, but grocery stores/delis, a laundromat, a bakery, a Chinese food place, a MacDonald's, a new Popeye's, Subway, 99cent store, hair supply store, and there's a park we call the Duck Pond in the area."

Springfield Gardens_f8cf9d2b-af6a-4236-b95d-5edd6c455806,"NYC has an extremely dense population, so the demand is always outpacing supply for living quarters. With that, properties are intentionally built to condense people into smaller and tighter living arrangements."

But those people are always claiming they're from out of town. The police are always driving around every once in a while and I'd deem this area pretty well secured. In the past, call for help, and they took a little too long to arrive, but it's been relatively okay."

On quiet nights, I like to stand outside by the street with my siblings and just talk, walking around the block or the empty lanes. On sunny days, we assemble a group of our friends and take walks to try and 'get lost' on our adventures just to figure our way back home. There's barely any gang violence, regardless of the motorcycle groups driving by or hanging around. I'm the first child to be born in the household and experience almost every part of my community.

Stuyvesant Town_9bef53e6-9a85-4b7f-9432-e108c4a277ff,"it is pretty safe. When crime happens it is usually because someone was personally negligent ( like walking home alone in early hours of the morning etc)"

You feel like you are in the suburbs with the way the buildings are set up but you can walk 5 minutes and you will be immersed in the cultures of the east village, union square, etc."

Sunnyside_317a6404-8e09-4d68-93de-25758042ee7f,"Sunnyside is a fantastic up and coming neighborhood in Queens.  Full of cultural diversity, Sunnyside promotes and encourages interaction with a variety of peoples and cultures.  Known for its local restaurants, the food and drinks are another great aspect of the community.  I would like to see smaller business flourish within the neighborhood as there are some empty store fronts.  The locals have their favorite place and they tend to stick to it."
Sunnyside_635de6e0-2ce6-40e1-be98-24515ba9faff,"Sunnyside is a great neighborhood with great amenities, restaurants, and public transportation. It is incredibly diverse with people coming from different racial and ethnic classifications. While rent has been going up, it is still more affordable than many cities in New York."

Sunnyside_c6cdba32-ea8f-4a8c-8c13-d07c466c302c,"As for the crime and safety of this neighborhood, I would say that it's okay. There hasn't been an alarming rate of crimes there. As well at night time there are many people out and and about even kids."
Sunnyside_7fda1dd6-d961-4400-8586-f76b72d98037,"I believe that the area that i live in has great diversity. As well everyone sees to know everyone in the neighborhood. The area is often filled with movie crews who are here to film scenes. It also has a variety of different restaurants and night life  for everyone. I would choose to live here because its such a tranquil and quiet area and clean as well. As for what i see for this area in the future is definitely gentrification since new businesses are opening up."
Sunnyside_d2b40e48-1d30-41d3-8bb8-35907466da24,"The area is great. The police is there when needed. It's a quite neighborhood which I like."

Sunnyside_429fd8e1-4817-4439-b0c9-739181b90ccf,"everything is always the same. However, I am starting to not like the police regulations and how they handle the situations because I was sexually harassed this summer. I was too afraid to do anything so I had to try my best to run home. I was too scared to even call the police. With the help of my friend and her brother, I was able to call the police. They did arrest the suspect but he doesn't seem be put in jail. My point of view on police changed from that experience."
Sunnyside_c305266d-2223-48d3-96e9-2fd834afff4e,"This area is a great place to live in. Everything is close to my home, from a grocery store to the train station. This neighborhood has really respectful people. Also, this neighborhood is a quiet and calm neighborhood."

Sunnyside_d1dac093-93f3-4ec9-9fca-16cee03b368a,"Ever since I went to high school, I have always loved playing with my friends indoor or outdoor. People around here are very active, every time when I had to take bus to school, I always have to wait at least 5 or more minutes and I see an old  Chinese lady doing mobility stretches, she does that I believed she does it everyday because I take Saturday class and I have take same bus that goes to my school, so I see her doing it. And also sometimes  I see ladies running. overall, my people are active."
Sunnyside_194d930d-5fed-4d17-b825-c1066b375a43,"I have never live in house, ever since I came to US I have live in a apartment. And fews year I liked it but once my top floor apartment people moved out. I hated it. Because the new people who moved up, are spanish and they party every day. And I loved the music but when i have test tomorrow, and I need rest and sleep good I can't never sleep. Because of that I feel like I gets low grade on my test. Thus, I loved to move out to country side one day where there is peace."
Sunnyside_31372ecb-461b-49bb-aade-b927383e589c,"The outdoor activities are about Okay because, there are fews park that are great, the court, beauty, baby play ground but the high school students take over everything and they make it so dirty, they buy drinks and they drink and not once they throw bottles into the garbage disposal."
Sunnyside_09fc1f94-b93e-44d1-a055-e17e10de38a0,"last year, my friend got jumped by three college students in park, and there was two uncover cops that I saw watching and enjoying my friend getting beat up. I was hearing their radio talking and I also saw their badge hanging under their crew neck. I feel very sad that I was counting on them to stop. Instead, I should support my friend or at least I should have stop the fight or jumped."
Sunnyside_57635d99-6eec-48c4-a599-12d85d40ffe0,"One story that really support this topic is when my older sister witness, a man robed a lady's iphone. My sister never saw the suspect's face but she did saw what clothes he was wearing. It's was black hoodie with blue jean and a boot. Now, she calls me when she leave her work place because she finished her job around 11:00 pm And it take 30 minutes to get home so when she get off from 7 train, she calls me to pick her up because she don't feel safe. After she told me this event, i also felt unsafe. Now, I leave part when sun start to go down."
Sunnyside_7b8ac039-b15e-4474-9793-157aa0a19fe6,"First of all, I don't trust weather and since NYC weather is so temperamental, I carry my umbrella where there is 20 or 30% of chance of rain. I also don't like NYC weather because it very cold and unpredictable. And when it get hot is gets super hot. And when it gets cold, it gets super cold."
Sunnyside_90cb4835-ea84-4576-a8a1-3209f9810cc7,"When I was freshmen in high school, I worked in fast food, and they didn't pay me well but most importantly, the people who I worked with are so means and dishonest people. Then after one years later, I had it enough I quit. Then Junior year, I was interest in Fitness, I went to YMCA, I volunteer here for 2 month and I asked my supervisor, if I can get a job? she said 'yes' and now I been working here  since my junior year. And I like people around here. And also they pay me wage I deserve."
Sunnyside_f405146b-6f14-496f-b176-ccb872ea0e10,"Most people in my neighborhood are Spanish and not lots of Asian live here. But there are so many of Chinese restaurants near my apartment. And my favorite is name Sunnyside Fresh Taco. There are two Sunnyside Fresh Taco near my neighbor. There is one, which is located 42-22 Greenpoint ave. The next store is located 45-59 46th Street. And my favorite is one where is located 45-59 46th street. Because another store says it fresh but I been there and is not fresh at all. My favorite dishes is #28B and #47."
Sunnyside_c7e46599-8783-4f03-9d78-bf545f6c62a6,"On my  neighborhood, there is GNC, a well known Fitness store in the world but this particular store is not the best because I have bought many items from them, not once they tread me like an customer. The sales men were very lazy and don't have good communication skills. Most importantly or more worst, the store is small and dirty."
Sunnyside_8dcd39a6-627d-45d1-9b29-79273bd68123,"There aren't that many amenities available for working out, such as gyms. I sometimes see people jogging but that is about it. I stay physically active by doing workout videos at home."
Sunnyside_c0efe7a0-e341-4643-bb93-fab276a5ecef,"There is a mix of homes and apartment buildings. Utilities are average, the area overall is pretty good. There are several schools nearby."
Sunnyside_93fb4e5c-ce9b-459c-82f1-cce7857f2513,"The winter can sometimes be severe. Snow storms and Nor'easter can lead to difficult, and sometimes dangerous commutes. The fall and spring are quite pleasant, it is not too hot or too cold. The summers are normally pretty hot, but it is great to have to heat for a few brief months. Overall, the weather in New York is manageable."
Sunnyside_b69eeaee-24ae-46ff-be0d-6347e03c1630,"I am not too involved in politics which is why I cannot give a fair input on our public services. There is a local fire station about five minutes away from my house and the fire department is always very responsive. One call, and five minutes later the fire truck arrives. The police station is about 20 minutes away from me. The police are extremely unresponsive, unreliable, and overall useless. The police officers in this area are only active in writing parking tickets. When it comes to crimes, or serious issues, it takes a few phone calls and a few more hours before officers finally arrive. By this time, the presence of a police officer is futile."
Sunnyside_cf176fe2-7512-4887-903f-1ef3c9caabfa,"Crime is not too visible in the area. However, the police are severely lacking. Patrol cars are almost nonexistent and the only time they are around, they are double parked entering Starbucks. If called, the police do not arrive until 3-4 hours later and it takes about 2-3 phone calls to physically have officers arrive. The 108 precinct needs more community policing."
Sunnyside_c8b290ec-6a12-4f6d-9434-0a9034af403e,"To begin, we just had a new deli open up in between a Gamestop and Chase bank.  I think it is very convenient because they make fabulous Philly Cheese Stakes, and all the locals come swarming in like bees to honey.  However, what if the Philly Cheese Stake did not go down the right way, and you begin to feel unwell?  Don't worry, there's a doctor's office right next to Chase bank.  What if you have a fear of doctors?  Well, there's a private pharmacy right next to the doctor's office!  The area is full of convenience!  A place where you can eat, withdraw money, get a check-up, and purchase some medicine!"

Sunnyside_af6731cd-5a8c-4ca5-b26f-301c500ed861,"Most people do have jobs but are not entirely satisfied with their jobs. Around this area there is a limited amount of jobs available and also many businesses are going out of business."

Sunset Park_023dbfb6-6aa6-4264-ac36-d625616bd6fa,"It's pretty good. I've lived there for 16 years and only recently moved because my family found an affordable house in Woodhaven. Most people are friendly in the neighborhood and Sunset Park, the park itself, is a great place to hang out and socialize. The whole community has a sort of homely, cozy feel to it. In the winter, there will be kids and adults shoveling snow outside and talking about the weather. In the summer, many barbecues and other events would happen around the neighborhood and it's pretty nice to be around all the action."
Sunset Park_7f86fbdb-4108-4c13-80db-00c43833493d,"I have been living in Sunset Park Brooklyn NY for more than 5 years. This is the Latino and Chinese major neighborhood. The 5th Ave has all kinds of grocery stores and many authentic Latino style restaurants. The 8th Ave is absolutely Chinese style area. You'll see Chinese characters everywhere, many Chinese authentic restaurants, fresh fruit and meat markets, and fancy and interesting festivals during Chinese festivals. Yet, the cost is relatively cheaper in this area. The rent is about $500 a room per month. Housing is alright but better condition compared to Manhattan. The subway and bus systems fully cover this area, the public transportation is very convenient. Weather wise, Sunset Park is humid in Summer, cold in Winter, very comfortable during Spring and Autumn. This area is close to the fun area in Manhattan and the beaches in Coney Island."
Sunset Park_6eb0fe21-0565-4349-a883-cc6bf4ac85a1,"Sunset Park is known to have hispanic and asian residents but in reality it is very diverse. There is a variety of restaurants and shops in every block. Bush terminal park is located in Sunset Park and it offers a beautiful view of the city and it also has many sport courts."
Sunset Park_4168c6fc-ea5e-425a-b6eb-8b98aee500f1,"Sunset Park is such a great neighborhood that i have been living  for more than 19 years. It is diverse from People that come from many different places of the world, such as; Mexican, PuertoRican, Salvadorian, Dominicans, etc.. Everyday i just see my community as a big  happy family, everyone contributes to the community by working hard so they can keep food on the table and a roof on top for their own family. People also gather around in food trucks at night, their would be these delicious tacos by 5avenue and there's never a day, in which that spot is empty.My friends and families are near by me and that just makes me feel happy and safer because i am surrounding by my love ones. My Community works so hard into making Sunset Park a better and safer place in order to prepare future neighbors. "
Sunset Park_0bdb41d6-eda4-47b4-be82-db3fa40157db,"Definitely less crime around than when I was younger."

Sunset Park_7ece33bc-1062-40bf-85fb-10d156a1fe41,"More restaurants that deliver could be in this area. Also we could use a post office a bit closer. Also there is a ton of construction going on around here which leads to so much noise."
Sunset Park_ef63d2cd-df84-499a-ae92-e7eb135b91bb,"You could see NYPD in 5 Ave pretty often, I personally never see them elsewhere in the sunset area. Plus, when you actually call 911, they come very very slow. I don't know what take them so long but it does make them seem unreliable."
Sunset Park_39c161bf-0cb7-4bcd-adfe-57a2c37e0964,"This Sunset Park area has always had a bad reputation. When I tell people I live in here their response to it is always negative. As a resident here, I would say that this area is not that bad in the way of safety. Crime rate has apparently decreased quite a lot. But in the way of entertainment, there is nearly no place for you to have fun."
Sunset Park_073b172b-65a6-40ae-9101-ba324f55f5b0,"Very quiet neighborhood. You never hear of any bad incidents occurring."

Sunset Park_8ce19e9a-83f0-44a7-8359-167c868c9ff3,"I dont think there is often crimes in this area. When there is crimes, the police are quick to act. A crime in this area isnt a rare occurrence but it happens."
Sunset Park_25d666b6-448a-47c5-a9a6-834710089bca,"I like living in this area because there are a lot of stores and places to go to. It's near the park and a lot of new restaurants and coffee shops have opened up, which is really nice. The atmosphere is generally calm, I would definitely live here again. This area is really nice, it's becoming an even nicer neighborhood since more people are moving here. I think in the future there will be more restaurants and shops which will make the neighborhood thrive."
Sunset Park_ac4c7d26-4681-4585-b716-6dd2b81b3ba7,"Crime is not a very big issue but lately there has been a case where woman has been disappeared for two months. Safety is okay as well."

Sunset Park_730ffa12-b861-430a-81af-912ae72bf14a,"I live in what some people call 'South Park Slope,' others 'Greenwood Heights,' and still others 'Sunset Park.' These name discrepancies come from the morphing of the neighborhood in recent years. There is a lot of gentrification happening all over Brooklyn, and I see it happening all around my home. It is very exciting to have more businesses around, restaurants to eat in, and renovated apartments to live in. But, I also have concerns about this gentrification process which in various ways makes the neighborhood less affordable for some who have lived here for years. Eventually it might be too expensive for me too. Still, the culture and diversity of Brooklyn as a whole makes it hard for me to imagine living anywhere else. I must begin to do so though because I will be attending graduate school in San Diego in the fall - a beach life is awaiting me."
Sunset Park_76329b43-794c-42ad-a130-b7501b80bd0f,"There aren't a lot of problems in this area. I wouldn't know about the reliability of the police department or other things of that nature because it seems to be that they are very rarely called."
Sunset Park_6853b241-95fe-4fba-aa5f-f27efa28305d,"There aren't a lot of problems, but everyone seems to be separated. No one really talks to anybody. Especially the new people who are moving into the new apartment buildings around my house. They don't really talk to anyone."

There are plenty of stores and restaurants nearby as well as buses and 3 major train lines for easy access to Manhattan or Coney Island. The area is pretty culture diverse, with primarily asian, central american, and caucasian residents. The local park is very large and hosts a recreational center with a pool in addition to its soccer fields, basketball courts, and winding sidewalks perfect for jogging. Sunset park is also the location of Greenwood Cemetery, a beautiful and historically rich acreage offering tours during the day. There are many nearby neighborhoods with more bells and whistles, but I definitely enjoy what convenience I have access to."

We have a poor library, no community centers, and no cultural centers. We do the same things every day. If you want to learn something and experience something new and exciting--you have to leave the neighborhood and go some place nicer. We are surrounded by bodegas and hair salons. That's what people see. There are no museums to open up a person's imagination. That doesn't exist in my little neighborhood. You have to take the initiative and leave to find opportunities. Sometimes people cannot see anything beyond what their life is in the neighborhood."

If you're trying to lose a couple of pounds, stay away from the bodega on my block--they have cake and ice cream up front. Hair and nail salons come and go with the seasons. The reason why is because there are at least three nail and hair salons on the same block. Everywhere you turn there is another salon! Nothing really stands out in my neighborhood."

There are regular  local events for families and young adults ('Faddy's Day parade, Little League Parade, Throggs Neck Ball, etc.). The waterfront views, the proximity to Pelham Bay Park, the access to the highway, and the sense of community make it a great place to live. You should own a car, public transportation is lacking (part of the charm), but no alternate-side parking rules. Public Schools here are horrendous, but lots of great private schools. It is a VERY safe neighborhood, without an overbearing police presence (although many live there). This is a predominately Irish and Italian neighborhood, with not too much diversity in culture or food, but in 45 minutes your'e in Manhattan and right in the thick of the melting pot. I'm a minority, and am never made to feel out of place."

Tompkinsville_8a89e65e-51b8-413d-9238-5f90e38b55e4,"Because this area is more of an urban area, there are lots of stores and businesses people can find employment in."
Tompkinsville_75acba22-47db-4be8-a2c1-639575ae689a,"The same local businesses have been around for a while and carry the same products they always have."

Tompkinsville_7a1a7af1-764b-4540-9c9f-050065deff10,"We experience all four seasons in one week. Especially in the winter. Sandy proved to be a tough storm, but it wasn't the worst thing to happen to this block. But it sucks that the New York City area has to worry about hurricane season when we never had to before..."
Tompkinsville_844a3093-3cb2-4380-ac9d-29af91abbe9c,"Borough hall is 20 minutes down the street from me, near the ferry and a police precinct. In the courtyard of borough hall, there are homeless people and high schoolers that smoke weed and do other types of drugs. That's what my government is doing for me: absolutely nothing. They don't care. At all."
Tompkinsville_1500b4d2-9ecc-4a77-b311-45257a120a1b,"This area is cared for because it's a main thoroughfare. It gets paved and repaired when it needs to be. Buses, cars, and trucks are always riding up and down the block. My largest complaint is the garbage trucks that speed down the block at 3 AM."
Tompkinsville_4667817e-1254-47b5-98c3-7fb935f6d239,"Most of the time, I can find things I need around here. The deli across the street is really nice. If I need something faxed, mailed, a gallon of milk, or some bread, I can get all of that."
Tompkinsville_03eff7db-68a5-46c9-b038-fe5a2a0c9d67,"Same faces for many years. I don't want to be here anymore. I'm going to school so I don't have to stay here."
Tompkinsville_0e1794cd-9f20-4f8b-b52c-840e2b0f18c6,"Most popular activity on this block: Smoking. There's a gym across the street, but I'm pretty confident that no one that uses it lives on this block."
Tompkinsville_1aef17b4-d0a6-4b05-925b-1c7e455db0dc,"Nothing to see here. Unless you're visiting someone's house, or here for an Albanian wedding party or something."
Tompkinsville_f238eb7e-4ecd-4685-8a34-c856cc2fbe9c,"Apartments, houses. Ho-hum. Nothing special about this block. Rather boring actually."
Tompkinsville_632a740f-2a9a-49e8-bf24-411966c377bf,"The LARGEST problem on this block is the intersection coming from Austin Place down onto Victory Boulevard. Cars coming from the parking lot on Austin Place crash into oncoming cars on Victory right in front of my building. This usually happens at night, and usually once or twice a year. It scares everyone in the building because the impact and sound can be felt through the floor and walls of the place."
Tompkinsville_ae5e8444-994e-4c13-a533-14ac042ef433,"People here are not that friendly in general. The kids that I grew up with in this building are not that great. I'm sure that no one here is really all that happy. I know I am not."
Tompkinsville_61a053d1-50e1-4a1a-a9c9-07e823667126,"I like the park near my house. (Silver Lake Park) I've seen efforts made to improve the park: planted flowers, cleanup of trees and other plant matter, spraying of pesticides, (this really doesn't seem to stop mice or rats from coming around at night) and repair of walkways. It's a nice place to walk around in, all things considered."
Tompkinsville_bb4f88fe-6781-43a5-b8f1-51eb983a5088,"I've lived here my whole life. If I had a choice, I'd move out immediately. I currently can't move out due to financial issues. I've never loved living here, but it's fine for now. Some people are friendly, others... not so much. I'm not a fan of the landlord of this apartment, and this place NEEDS to be redone, but again, it's fine for now."
Tottenville_c87e2274-16d2-4c37-a606-8593dcdeb7f3,"I grew up right outside of Tottenville.  Then it was just a small town where you knew everyone's name and everyone was friendly.  There was one grocery store in town and not much else to do.  Now Tottenville is booming.  There are restaurants, pharmacies, grocery stores, jewelry stores, clothing stores, you name it, Tottenville's got it."
Tottenville_2cca484d-9f54-46f6-a9a1-f504a9b16898,"Living in New York, this skews my perception of crime as living in a big city there is more of it than other areas of the country but as far as comparing to the other boroughs, safety is pretty decent here.  The biggest issue you face on Staten Island is drug (use and very high incidence of overdose) and assault."
Tottenville_fa868aeb-2549-4048-910c-6378e9fc7b4c,"Living on Staten Island has gotten less appealing as the years go on.  The biggest turn off for me is the cost of living.  You are paying city prices for most things but not getting the benefits of living in a city (i.e. Walkability, easy public transportation, interesting amenities, etc.)  You have to pay, no matter what, to leave the island to get anywhere whether it be the other boroughs or New Jersey.  Being a democrat, it is also very hard as this is the only republican borough in NYC and they are very vocal about their stances on certain things.  The people are not the best either; it is very rare that you have a positive interaction here."
Tottenville_ca8f7b0c-ba66-4b56-892f-67f4dc471d97,"The area is pretty safe and quite. There aren't many cases of gun violence or gang activity. There are occasional attempted break-ins/robberies or domestic disputes."
Tottenville_8dd7995e-eb02-48a6-9df2-f14e2d0e4554,"The area is nice and close to family but some of the other people in the neighbourhood are aggressive"
Tottenville_fc1fd1b4-26d2-4d6d-8850-65e40e0c113d,"In my neighborhood in Staten Island, crime is at a minimum. However, there are areas of Staten Island that are more prone to crime. For the most part, the most popular crimes are typically drug related. Staten Island has a sort of drug epidemic happening."
Tottenville_9349dc12-0a80-45d0-9170-9f8c103de2a1,"I do enjoy living in Staten Island, however I wouldn't choose to live here again if I could. I enjoy more of an urban neighborhood, rather than a suburban one like Staten Island. I'd say it is an above average place to live, but it's nickname of 'the forgotten borough' speaks volumes."

Tottenville_190f74f7-d261-4c65-8750-1a53948454c1,"There is quite a large variety of stores in this area. Target, Applebee's, Christmas Tree Shop, Modell's Sporting Goods, Dunkin Donuts, Z Two Restaurant, and Sally Beauty Supply, are all located in adjacent shopping centers in Charleston. The workers are relatively nice and the service is good."

Or they are in a local union also earning benefits. There are a very large amount of small buisness owners around me, who usually do not have such benefits."
Tottenville_d1c4efa5-1687-4ee7-9f4f-4a621db0761d,"The business of Tottenville, Staten island is mostly local 'mom-and-pop shops' with  a large amount of Italian restaurants.My parents own the local plumbing company, and I am exposed to the daily struggles they deal with. There aren't as many big companies, except for a target and home improvement stores. This can be hard to get certain things."

The main issue I have is that transportation is really unreliable as Tremont gets crowded fast during certain points of the day, and the main bus (BX 40/42) doesn't run nearly reliably enough to be of use. "

I go to school here, so I'm often here for many hours between classes. It seems like if you're rich, it would be a great place to raise a family."
Tribeca_5a6b45a7-486e-4cfa-89ce-a7368d5702a7,"Tribeca was once the neighborhood of trailblazers who settled into the community before it was 'the place to be.'  One would awaken to the aroma of the Martinson's Coffee warehouse located at what now is Robert DiNero's hotel and restaurant at the southwest corner of Greenwich and North Moore Streets.  On weekdays, one would encounter the hustle and bustle of  egg and cheese purveyors at their warehouses, that are now condo lofts, scattered throughout the neighborhood; now offices workers dominate those streets.  Evenings used to remind me of nights in the low desert of the Mojave Desert in Southern California, sans the cry of coyotes.  Now, there are street lights along Greenwich Street where  stop signs once were while teens used it as a football field.  The  peaceful nights, aromatic days, and easy commute attracted me to Tribeca.  The shopping, restaurants, and enviable housing deal keep me here, though not necessarily in that order."

As long as I stay to yourself and don't engage in conversation or communication with anyone I know ill be fine. The police are sporadic in my neighborhood,  I usually see them when something has happened or they have been called to a scene. What I have noticed is a strong domestic violence presence in this neighborhood. I have neighbors that have extremely loud disputes with their spouse almost every other night. Sometimes the police will respond to this."
Unionport_c13c1f45-c712-433b-98ad-00d488644a21,"Overall, my area is decent. All basic services such as, markets, laundry mats, gas stations, drug stores, beauty supply stores and transportation are all made accessible. The atmosphere most of the time is fairly peaceful with little to no violence. There isn't any sense of community due to the fact that a large portion of the population are middle eastern and they stay among themselves, maybe because of the language barrier. The sidewalks and streets are not in good condition, they are cracked and ridged and have caused a lot of accidents. In my future I would not choose to live here because I prefer environments that are up-kept and have a more inviting atmosphere and sense of community."
Unionport_9284696a-93a2-45d1-a804-7609f3dd1bac,"I have had to incidents in this past year when I had to call the cops. The police showed up more than an hour later. I now bought myself mace so I can defend myself because calling the cops is a waste of my time."
Unionport_ca2bcc6d-9112-4050-9d5d-96f54f0e71c2,"It's an ok neighborhood. Rent is too high to move to a better neighborhood. Everything is so expensive and the government seems to only help those who are unemployed. The working class struggle more just to make ends meet."

This happens at various times in the day and its consistent and annoying to the people who want to be positive and have a great future to be around such bad habits. personally i do not have children but if i did i wouldn't want to raise them in such an environment. if i did they would think tat the things going on around us would be normal, and it isn't. I rated my experience as 'It's bad' but if i did have children it would have been rated as 'It's the Worst'."

The restaurants however are mostly placed along one street which can make you have to walk a bit to get to it. There aren't many small café stores which can be inconvenient. Most of the stores take a 15 to 20 minute walk for the most part."
University Heights_811dfa62-a6f6-4198-883a-aee512920e81,"My parents were in a car accident in this neighborhood because the other driver was speeding, a pedestrian was hit by a car a few weeks ago but that's the most that has happened in four years. Public transportation can get congested while getting to my neighborhood."
University Heights_0d5c9d35-0753-4cc1-ade0-426280111d18,"I don't have anything to say about fire fighter or police since they seem to respond appropriately. However, I feel the post office is irresponsible and loses packages, mails packages and envelopes to the wrong addresses. I didn't receive an package but I was told someone had signed it for me, it was mail fraud but they weren't very helpful."
University Heights_dcebae94-25bc-4749-aad3-028822bc847d,"Food is dominican food, soul food, and Chinese food. The food is good and its can be delivered at anytime in the day."
University Heights_79398133-3cfd-4e77-b9fa-7c5bac0e0858,"In the winter, it cold as it should but snow doesn't usually pile up because we clean it up. Spring, and summer are great because everyone has flowers in the neighborhood. Fall is hard work because the trees shed a lot !"

Upper East Side_9251f411-0883-4dae-b70e-83dbe62aae97,"I have been living in the Upper East Side for three years, and I adore it. Living near the park has been essential to my mental health and has given me great focus when it comes to my education. New York can be so overwhelming and congested, but the Upper East Side is like nowhere else: it is quiet, calm and extremely friendly. I can't imagine living anywhere else in New York."
Upper East Side_724346e2-38a2-4a58-a9f1-77aa98784962,"Friendly, clean, and many great restaurants! There are subways and buses in this neighborhood that typically run on schedule.  There are convenience stores, gyms, coffee shops, and schools all within walking distance."
Upper East Side_6222f00f-128c-4349-b531-c15f4449e693,"Great neighborhood, especially now that the Second Avenue subway has opened, making public transportation throughout the City much more efficient. Lots of great restaurants and cafes."
Upper East Side_7a914bf1-c559-488a-a179-792cab13d45c,"The Upper East Side allows you to be a part of a community while still being in a major city. There is much less NYC hustle and bustle running through this homey neighborhood."
Upper East Side_550ded9c-b21f-4252-80a7-7328b48611ea,"The Upper East Side is quiet and has plenty of affordable restaurants near my residence that are open late and deliver. Essential shops and locations are located walking distance ( i.e post office, pharmacy, city md, target etc.)"

Upper East Side_4257f027-e975-4b4f-8733-3575150652d4,"very few incidents, very safe area, but lately there have been a few incidents. I don't feel threatened being alone on the street after dark, but I feel the street lights could be better."
Upper East Side_d186601a-7e3e-4338-8f75-e18b105aa4a3,"For the last few years, it's been difficult with building the Second Avenue subway, traffic is bad, stores are having difficulty with construction blocking their storefronts. Once finished it should make life better."
Upper East Side_24fac561-8119-431c-aeb5-30ee57418448,"I feel very safe in this neighborhood during the day and at night."
Upper East Side_eac27517-666a-4a5c-912c-620d56ab1b8e,"This area is great. It's very residential but it seems that as each week goes by, more and more restaurants and shops keep popping up which is exciting. Also, soon we will have the second avenue subway which will improve this area even more."

Upper East Side_fbcfffe0-42a6-4b26-8e55-7702816a7d9e,"Mostly crime seems okay. It doesn't seem like there is much crime around. However on the first day I checked to see if my keys worked in my new building, there was a sign on the door from the super explaining that a thief had been let in by saying he had a package, and that the thief had to be chased out. This was scary. Since then there has not been a problem, but I am very cautious when buzzing someone into the building."
Upper East Side_f4e107bd-2e29-4cf9-a71e-8051d7024677,"The area is fine, however it doesn't feel like it has character at all. There is nothing special about it in my opinion. There are bodegas on many corners and you can find what you need. There are not many cool places close in vicinity to me. Near 86th st. there are more options and further downtown there are more, but in the 70s there is not much variety on York Ave. It is close to my school so it is convenient. I do love my church. It is an exceptional church in NYC. Very welcoming and open, something that is very comforting to find in a Catholic church in NYC. I appreciate how many families attend mass there."
Upper East Side_094bb36b-73cc-4167-b88b-997fcf1b70f3,"Within the past year a woman was struck and killed by a school bus on an unmarked, unpatrolled crosswalk. The crosswalk possibly wasn't marked due the the second avenue subway's constant change of sidewalk routes, i.e., barricades protuding into the road to create a walkable route."
Upper East Side_10f1305c-baab-4e10-8bfb-31677881101d,"Due to the second avenue subway construction, businesses were forced to close due to their decline of sales and/ or hidden storefront. In addition, construction is permitted underground 24/7 and above ground starting at 6am, causing noise at unwelcoming times. When the construction completes in our area in December 2016, it willl bring easier access to the rest of New York City."
Upper East Side_e8c76054-32a9-466d-ae5a-5cfbc3f4e0a1,"I haven't been in a situation where I needed the police to be involved.  They're in the subway station fairly frequently patrolling. Overall I think it is a safe area."
Upper East Side_e17dc51d-1dcf-42a4-9e1a-5179f19eca68,"Overall, it has been a good experience.  Everything I need is within a block or two and it is a safe area."

If so, it's the random young hoodlum from another neighborhood robbing cell phones from middle school kids. But mostly, the neighborhood is safe and I feel protected by the sight of police everywhere I go."
Upper East Side_de37e2d4-1eb7-466f-89ea-bdf72ad5aa3b,"It's considered the best, most affluent area of all of Manhattan. The public schools I attended are the best around. I mostly like it here a lot because it's very safe and the cleanest part of city. The only downside is as a young adult, there aren't too many activities within close walking distance for my interests. But that's what transit is for, where I access to other neighborhoods to explore."
Upper East Side_c96d0bee-919f-40c5-9438-da72696d9a26,"It is great, we just need a subway line closer to the East side."
Upper East Side_5d0be6e4-e391-4f3e-8d1b-9bdc29f5371b,"I really enjoy living on the upper east side. Manhattan is a beautiful place, and if I had to choose, I would probably stay. There are obviously some drawbacks, such as high cost of living, extreme poverty alongside extreme wealth, dirty streets, laundry is far away, etc. But some great things are wonderful places to dine out, you meet people from all over, they atmosphere is lively and contagious, you have everything at your doorstep."

Upper East Side_a2b66458-8cb8-4b40-a5f6-9c1caacfb86e,"I love living in the city although everything is getting more expensive and the city becoming more exclusive for rich people we pay the highest taxes and do not get much back as people like in long Island where they have more free facilities in the summer and winter for children. The city pools should be exclusive for each area as well as other facilitates to control the crowd. More attention should be paid to city for the amount of tax paid by tax payers."

According to the 2000 census 48,983 people live in the community. Of the population, 44% are of Hispanic origin, 32% are African Americans, and 24% are Asians, whites, and other races.  Crime & Safety Report states the area as the second-safest place in Manhattan.  

President Obama once lived two blocks away.  Seinfeld fans may appreciate visiting Tom's 24 hour coffee shop (where the show was taped.)  The 106th cross street was once home to the renowned jazz musician Edward Kennedy “Duke” Ellington. There are many restaurants named in his honor."
Upper West Side_16cd56d6-a9d7-432c-a449-b41e7c40273c,"I have been living on the UPPERWEST Side or as we like to call it UWS for 18 years now and I love it. It has changed a lot, and we have so many new shopping stores that have opened. The only thing that I wish would change is more availability for parking because not a lot of activity goes on in the UWS and not a lot of traffic happens either."
Upper West Side_beb359d6-a212-4cb0-a0be-26ef6eb0e3ba,"I like the Upper West Side because it feels like a town within the city. I feel safe and welcomed here. If anything I would make it a more accessible place. I would love a subway to the East Side instead of just a bus."
Upper West Side_88432b81-2089-4ebe-abd3-36e9e1eb6a6f,"A great, but expensive, place to live. Moderate night life, but more available just outside of it. Local jobs are scarse, mom and pop shops are dissapearing, but big name chains are available."
Upper West Side_49252060-d958-4fd6-a794-c01febbb8d6b,"The upper west side is a wonderful, clean, safe, family-oriented place to live. There is a lot of turn over in terms of restaurants and shops due to rising rent levels but overall the stores are of high quality."
Upper West Side_f9a52730-8138-4564-af6e-24c4cf1de6be,"Great family friendly neighborhood with a real sense of community.  All this and close to Central Park!"
Upper West Side_093bea21-d0b8-40ba-8f79-b709ea218344,"Living in the UPW is truly amazing. From having many food option's around you or just walking down the block to the trainstation/bus stop is what makes it that way. The view is also a great part of this general area. Central Park is very close by so you can always just take a walk to the east side or sit in the park and enjoy the day. There isn't anything I'd want changed in this neighborhood, it is a great living area for families and singles !"
Upper West Side_a4da0d4a-a8b5-4834-822c-0ff358a22f06,"I love it! I have lived here all my life, and I can't imagine ever leaving. I love the people, the streets, the schools, the parks, the view, the library---and it's all conveniently located in Manhattan!"
Upper West Side_1219a981-448c-45f0-ab1a-f5c47c312d88,"The Upper West Side is unique in its magic. It is where you'll find the confluence of Native New Yorkers, college students, young professionals, families, artists and musicians.In addition you have a host of neighborhood bars studded around where you can find live music (Jazz, Salsa etc), organizations of the local pool leagues and even a drag performance here and there. I suppose a lot can be a miss if you're not an explorer but the beauty is there for any who choose to find it."
Upper West Side_10264442-a5b2-4ada-a70e-b0d655e050fb,"There isn't much crime in the area of the UWS that I live in, maybe up higher. I find it to be safe besides a few homeless people here and there that could be dangerous late at night."
Upper West Side_8831c54c-9d4b-4d6d-a137-f71e36d04a8b,"It is a nice area in Manhattan, but it is still expensive. It's hard finding an apartment in NYC that is close to college but doesn't break the bank in rent. The area is safe, has plenty of places to eat, and has many different subway lines going through it."

I love how close the subway station is from my apartment makes its easy and convenient whenever I go out. The atmosphere is friendly and neighborly and it provides a sense of safety and security for the community which is amazing. There are several prep schools, high schools, and colleges in the area as well which provide a dynamic social environment. Not to mention Central Park only a few blocks away and the Hudson River opposite the park. The area is growing, but remains clean, friendly, and polite for tourists or anyone in the neighborhood."
Upper West Side_2a04247b-2172-479c-8ef9-5a2c62cd81d3,"Police are present and, for the most part, feel safe.  However, there has been an uptick in subway attacks and street safety (too much traffic) and lots more homeless and transient adults in the neighborhood."
Upper West Side_df386a86-2cc6-4347-be0b-27e1d79bba52,"Best people watching ever, great diversity, great cultural opportunities -- wonderful place to live except cost of housing is very high and space is at a premium."

Upper West Side_f4774c23-4f8f-49c1-9e53-742d1ec96311,"The Upper West side is very family oriented. Shop keepers, bank tellers, doormen know you. There are a lot of food stores and small shops that make life very convenient. The best thing is having two fabulous parks, Riverside and Central Park so close...whenever you need a dose of 'green'."

Upper West Side_ef2f768d-44ed-4209-99ea-d513dcb7e6cb,"No crimes really, only twice in ten years has there been a robbery, there are more car accidents than crime. There is a corner that is a sharp turn and others like it so there has been some car accidents recently."
Upper West Side_e5c492d0-6c88-4b2e-bc28-2822a20bc3a3,"I honestly have not been aware of crimes and safety considering my neighborhood is safe to me but others I am not too sure, everyone has their own different situation in this area."
Upper West Side_3b8c79de-d394-4457-b47d-907764450a19,"I would live here again, I would not mind I grew up here the past 18 years and have been perfectly fine."

Upper West Side_cb68aa5d-9a3f-432a-84a6-77d5468dbcb3,"I think its bad even though I live here and I am used to the occasional violent action that usually goes on in a projects area. But unlike me for people who do not live in this type of environment for them it is very scary and usually prefer not to come to these types of areas."
Upper West Side_f7cfa022-bd0c-4f99-9278-2822f5b8fd17,"I think my area is not the best place to be in because it varies with certain times of the year. For instance during the fall and winter months it can be much more intimidating to come to this part of Brooklyn because it looks frightening to people who are not out used to the projects like me. But, during the spring and summer months when he neighborhood is a lot more lively and you can find events going on in Red Hook as well."

Upper West Side_808b0d85-8378-4a6a-8a69-d57a793dc9a3,"For Manhattan, this neighborhood is abnormally friendly. People are generally open and friendly. Fordham University and Julliard have small campuses at Lincoln Center, NYIT at Columbus Circle, and John Jay in Hell's Kitchen. This adds a whole other layer of community to the neighborhood."
Upper West Side_9feff051-42f5-4021-88a7-577708581632,"The Upper West Side is the second safest neighborhood in Manhattan, statistically speaking (right after Central Park). The area has a heavy concentration of wealth and families. This leads to a community that is actively improving their neighborhood and ensuring it's safety. The presence of landmarks such as Columbus Circle, Lincoln Center, and The Natural History Museum also ensure that there are police present constantly."
Upper West Side_34e0b6c0-8fd5-45fb-a155-5f7d5901e4d5,"The Upper West Side is a wonderful place to live. Because it runs up against Midtown West and Hell's Kitchen it's easy to access nightlife and work. But it's surprisingly nice to retreat to a quieter corner of Manhattan after a long day or night."

Everyone from young families, older couples, to students live in the area. The neighborhood is one of the safest and cleanest in New York. Another plus: not too many tourists clogging up the street! You could eat in a different restaurant for every meal for the rest of your life and you wouldn't be able to get to all of the restaurants in the neighborhood. Everyone is friendly (despite what the rest of America thinks of New Yorkers!) and I plan on raising a family here when the time comes. UWS is a 5 star experience!"

Upper West Side_e8408a86-2c38-4ea0-8d64-95438e3fce37,"The housing is great, there is really no issue in terms of the aesthetic or how well homes are taken care of. I don't mind the occasional graffiti so this is not really an issue for me. The biggest issue with the neighborhood is the dramatically rising cost of housing. 

I would say the best placed to reside in this neighborhood are near the riverside park or central park. Also the neighboring areas around Columbia University/Barnard/City College are beautiful and more reasonably priced."
Upper West Side_69ee5169-612e-433c-8e50-4eed4e36937c,"There are a lot of private gyms in the neighborhood as well as speciality classes available. There are not really any public options but there are some private gyms that are reasonably priced. People are relatively fit and physically active. When the weather gets warmer you can often see people jogging gang biking. There are also a number of hospitals near buy- St. Lukes and Roosevelt. Beyond these public hospitals there are many urgent care facilities in the neighborhood."

It seems the winter is colder and longer and the spring is colder as and shorter as well. The most essential things in my closet this past year have been my down jacket and my rain boots. 

Summers are the best time in NYC. That is when you can jog outside and enjoy the weather and explore the city more."
Upper West Side_a1fa2a0d-fbcc-420f-9373-0cf9ac3ae31b,"Thereare a lot of food options in this area. There are new restuarants constantly opening up as well as the old timers which have been in the neighborhood for some time but remain delicious. 

There are a good number of new coffee shops that have opened up which have definitely been welcomed in the area. Currently some of my favorites are Irving Farm Roasters, Box Kite, and Aroma. They all have great food options as well. 

As well the upper west side is known for having a large Jewish populaiton, as such there are great food options like Zabars (super marker), Barney's Greengass, and Fine and Shapiro that serve delicious lox, bagels, and pastrami. The best bagel in NYC is also at Absolute Bagels."

That being said the Upper West Side is quite residential so there are few corporations and or business offices in the neighborhood. 

There are a lot of restaurants and new coffee shops in the neighborhood so there are probably more opportunities for service jobs then any other occupation in this area"
Upper West Side_9acce2a0-e6fe-455c-b7fa-748283702b4e,"On the upper west side there is a huge variety in terms of the stores that are nearby and accessible.

Though the neighborhood has changed significantly in the past years, bringing more Duane Reade and CVS stores on every other corner there are still a significant number of delis and a great variety of food options."

The facility is pleasant, clean and the staff are very polite, and they'll always go out of their way to assist you.

Unfortunately, most of the shoot out occurs midday. A public elementary school sits right across the street. Police patrols the neighborhood constantly. I like to presence of the police. I wish they could patrol 24/7. The police recently set up and van a few blocks away to monitor the ongoing crime within the neighborhood. I witnessed a driver skipped the light more than once as well in my neighborhood."

On the other side of the fence, you see the grungy New York Housing called 'Farragut Houses'. The brick wall building soar the sky with black smoke and the residence doesn't make the neighborhood look any better. The working people keep busy and quiet. However, other residence fill the streets with drugs instead of uplifting the community. I live in Farragut Housing apartment for the past 5 years. I don't speak to my neighbors and I know to not walk the streets at night. But when you walk toward the water closer to Dumbo, this neighborhood transforms in a hip tourist excitement. It's a mixture between poor and rich. It's beautiful to look at the view and the condo's around me. It just depends on which side of the fence your on."

Wakefield_c34a76e8-de51-4863-b022-1baac2a92d3c,"The neighborhood is fairly quiet, several schools are in the vicinity of my home.The area is kept clean and is family friendly, food shopping is very accessible, it is very close to the New England Thruway which I use very frequently. There are several amenites available to keep the children active, and a public library for after school reading."
Wakefield_39b54583-3d69-43ac-8551-9471997e64ae,"In this particular area there is not much going on however it is close to neighborhoods and project buildings that do suffer from a high crime rate."
Wakefield_bacda167-470e-4fb1-a024-3f4b065251f1,"The accessibility with everything is perfect, everything is around restaurants, notaries, clothing stores, pharmacies. However it is close to neighborhoods with high crime rates but not in this particular area."
Wakefield_2534e21d-264c-4de8-b20c-72ca19e9dcf9,"Crime is really not really prevalent in the area. Most of the residents are Jamaicans, Hispanics, and Guyanese so they know each other well and are friendly towards one another. However, when crimes do occur it's usually young men targeting each other."
Wakefield_8301e802-1193-4d81-9c52-d29a6bceb288,"I want to move out of the area. The kids are rude, their parents are no better. The school system is horrible. If you send your kids to the schools in the area, their personality will quickly change for the worse, and they will most likely graduate high school with a  low GPA. I cannot see any great changes in the future of this area."

Wakefield_bf0d1a69-7de3-41cf-8b42-39b83b36a916,"I would choose to live here again people the neighborhood has a lot of diversity.

Wakefield_1a2ef3a4-dd26-4962-a640-a77ce8d6b5c9,"Compared to some of the other boroughs, the Bronx in my area seems to be the safest. I have only witnessed the first and possibly the last shooting where one man shot down another man back in 2006. Although I was with my mother and my brother at that time, I was scared of my community and realized the bug picture of thee world outside my borders. Years have passed and I have adjusted to my community since that fateful day."
Wakefield_f430d3d5-ee3f-4a15-8b0a-2ba71872b4c3,"There are only few times when thunderstorms occur in my area. When they happen, the power is usually cut down to a minimum and the power outages are rare. Otherwise, my area is safe to live in."

Wakefield_5893c42f-12e9-4e65-b84e-08ddaff206b2,"For my time in living in the Bronx, I have never offered to partake in a part-time job in my own community. Since my lifestyle is at a sustainable level, I did not need to get a part-time job until I was at college."
Wakefield_dcb7ed10-ffdf-4ed4-920f-17a19d8280f6,"Around the areas where I live there seems to be a trend of convenience stores, deli markets, beauty salons, barber shops and lesser known stores. I feel as though there are too many of these stores congregated in one place as it devalues creativity in the job market for individuals."

Wakefield_159693c0-2359-413d-bf10-30852cc5992e,"There's too many drug dealers in the neighborhood to feel comfortable.

Wakefield_c1ce39ef-d475-40f9-bc76-703290e73c6c,"I love the food in my area, but to be honest the the main type of food in this neighborhood is West Indian food, mostly Jamaican. That's fine because it's delicious, but there isn't much variety. There's also maybe one or two Spanish food places and a few generic Chinese food places. Overall it's good quality food, just not diverse. My neighborhood doesn't have any sort of restaurant that serves alcohol."
Wakefield_29df4fa4-091b-43ef-b52b-efaf7b7135cd,"I feel as though the business owners in my neighborhood are pretty close knit and friendly with those in my neighborhood.  They'll support each other in times of need. For instance, a few connected businesses and a mosque burned down two years ago and the other neighborhood businesses came around and helped any way they could. My only issue is that it seems that there are more franchised establishments popping up in the neighborhood, taking away the homey feeling."

The idea of them being there adds to my sense of safety but then not so much when I consider reported treatment of civilians (depending on your sex and other factors that should be non-determinant of treatment)."
Wakefield_91fac56b-744e-413b-bcd3-525d428d528f,"A more accurate rating is a 3.5, but I feel like there is a good enough availability in this area (good banking, something quick and cheap or the more larger retail stores like Walgreen's and Rite Aid). There is also a very good bakery and multiple markets that suit preference (Shop & Stop/Keyfood/Food town). The only thing I wish we had was a Barnes & Nobles (but of course you can only find them in the city or near upstate). I like that there aren't a lot of big companies--they don't really fit after a point."
Wakefield_f83820a3-5a77-47fa-90d8-d859ceb674e0,"I cannot really give an informed response. I am not very involved in the status of job outlook,top employers, etc. in my area."

We lived in an older pre-war building with residents that I had occupied the apartments for over 60 years. The restaurants and food options in the neighborhood were incredible. I would rate the safety at probably a 3 because even though people on my block recognized me I still wouldn't feel safe walking home alone at night."

Washington Heights_987b1f01-9f37-40af-b0c9-afdcc4cc5c1e,"I love the music that permeates the night air and the smells of incredible Dominican food in my building. I don't like the displacement of long-time community members and families because of gentrification. The Starbucks on the corner, the novelty yogurt shops and the ironic hipster conversations on the line at the now-overpriced  supermarket are threatening to strip the neighborhood of its flavor and value, gutting it of its soul."

Washington Heights_972127c2-b960-4380-8cb6-afe398229758,"I go to graduate school in Washington Heights. It's a good commute because the A/C and 1 all stop here express and local, however construction has been going on for years and you can't exit the 1 train without taking often-broken elevators. There are frequent delays. CUMC makes the area a little safer, however it isn't necessarily safe to wander east of Broadway alone after hours. There are many families here, but it isn't very clean and there isn't a great restaurant or activity scene.  There are some pro bono clinics and resource centers for elderly people."
Washington Heights_1f7da032-0f5c-459d-a46c-94aa0010452f,"I like the diversity when it comes to stores. Various options on restaurants. Something that I would like to see change is the drug dealers near train stations and hookah pipes on the streets."
Washington Heights_940d6da9-ef54-47fd-b443-bbe1974c82fb,"I love Washington Heights because it embodies Latino cultural. In particular, the majority of the people who reside in Washington Heights are from the Dominican Republic, so every step that you take within this neighborhood, you're bound to hear spanglish, and be embraced by the the loud music played in the barbershops and cars passing by. All in all, it's a beautiful neighborhood, with a lot to offer."
Washington Heights_d9e53cf5-9bc9-4ea5-a94a-1d498f07b68d,"I grew up here. As much as I would like to give a positive review to my neighborhood, there is not that much of anything positive about it. The only positive thing I can think of is that it feels like home if you are Hispanic/Latino (which I am). However, it is not a very safe area due to gangs and delinquents in, almost literally, every corner. The public schools I went to were also bad. However, my younger brother is in the same elementary school I went to and it seems to have gotten better."

Although it is known as a Hispanic neighborhood, it is actually more diverse then people think. It's also really safe, even at night. I've never heard of any crime or seen any crime happen in this neighborhood. They have lots of festivals and fairs in the summer and the people are always smiling. They even hold small concerts. There are several places that you can visit for fun such as the Cloister museum and Fort Tryon Park."
Washington Heights_3fba4ec9-483b-4e03-a5e6-1a16b5724b1a,"It's a safe neighborhood in most areas, though some streets are more precarious at night. Lots of young professional families are moving in. Public schools are still not good, and it can feel a bit far from the best manhattan nightlife downtown. Beautiful parks-- this neighborhood has the most park land out of any NYC neighborhood!"

Washington Heights_ce99af01-ce7f-422e-baae-5e061e5ae276,"Tons of people from the Dominican Republic live here. It's average to just below average living. It depends on what street you live, then you can manage to avoid the illegal  activities going on around the area."
Washington Heights_79f26505-1ff2-458b-bbd9-6b72010f7f6b,"I know crime happens in my area yet its not something that is constantly talked or heard about. The police are very visible and quick to respond. As a 22 yearly female, I feel very safe in this area."
Washington Heights_e520b13f-b104-4411-a40b-0f6e3de5f9e8,"The area I live in is okay, if I had the choice I wouldn't live here. I want to live in a nicer part of the city but as a young 22-yearold I don't have much choice. My apartment is nice and I like where I live. It's quiet yet there are always people around in case of an emergency. There are a few grocery stores and pharmacies in the area. There are plenty of nice restaurants however, which is sending change in a good direction. Having a hospital in walking distance is reassuring, as first response tends to be slow in a city. I live 5 minutes away from the subways which can get me to midtown about 20 minutes."
Washington Heights_5fe2bf03-4308-46bd-9d19-5d25820a79e6,"I've been living in this neighborhood since I've been born. I've never had an issue with public safety and society. It's very calm and no one bothers anyone."
Washington Heights_7a025c45-c32d-42b5-b367-58fc399800a7,"My neighborhood is going through gentrification. As more chain stores open up, more people move in but those who are richer and the poorer are getting kicked off."

Additionally, my house resides in the corner of the neighborhood and it is the perfect location to view the sunrise and sunset each day. This is definitely considered a perfect neighborhood since it is right next to our incredible zoo and up the block, it is convenient to be able to get membership at the Y.M.C.A."

The people who live here have culture, and have caring hearts. Old people vibe and listen to music together outside, converse and play with their grand children. Everyone is hard working but there is beauty in their handwork and struggle. There's different cultures in every apartment and home, every door smells of a different but delicious food."

Some of the private properties that are located near the buildings have enough space for each respective home owner."
West Farms_cefe5701-8547-4e3d-a1e5-7a625fc28046,"Some of the most admirable attractions that we posses include the Bronx Zoo and the Botanical Garden, which are very adjacent to the residents that reside in such are.

The quality of such stores is food, but there is always room for improvement. For example, a particular supermarket that is located near my building needs more clerks or cashiers, since there are many people that attend to such supermarket."
West Farms_17fc58df-24d3-4ffa-8962-dac9b2f0cfa5,"The overall conditions of my neighborhood can be said to be fair because even though there is lots of pollution, local residents have taken action in planting trees and doing other actions in order to diminish the propagation of health issues within such area. In regards to drug usage, I would say that it is very high and officials should try to do something about this because it is a constant menace to younger individuals who reside within the area."

West Village_be1c0139-2ce4-4f94-a316-6c9d4ccd47c0,"I don't know that many people in my area, but most have a liberal agenda to so far left that they are off the map.  It's pretty progressive here in this neck of the woods, even the public schools here are hands on and so highly desired there is a waiting list."
West Village_bc9b5606-45b7-443a-bfb4-22459373f457,"In the winter it's not great, but it's the northeast and it gets cold.  Luckily New York City has effective snowplows that get the job done fairly quickly.  As for potholes it's an issue because there are a lot of older streets in the area, many of which are cobble stone and they can cave in a bit as they were originally made for the weight of horses and carriages not cars and delivery trucks.  In the summer it can get really really hot because of the sidewalks and pollution from stores nearby and buildings the heat can feel like its radiating from every direction, the sun, concrete below and stores, dresses and shorts are helpful."
West Village_f21a90cb-d59c-4a1d-a151-ee21a6998250,"There is not much crime in the area, the police precinct is a few blocks away from where I live.  In all the years I have lived here the biggest crimes have been robbery's because the neighborhood does have a lot of wealthy residents that go away to other houses for vacation and leave their apartments unattended or drunk crimes, such as noise complaints.  The public intoxication crimes that sometimes cause vandalism etc. effect me directly because a bar called Automatic Slims is on my block, my guess is for other people it might not be as much of an issue as most streets are residential only."
West Village_c8dffe12-9288-4427-a288-5e80d5e0dd49,"The food in this area is amazing there is a little bit of EVERYTHING.  There are food trucks, diners, delis, bodega's, five star eatery's, celebrity chef restaurants, and almost every cuisine a person could think of.  The only downside is it can be expensive if you don't know where to go.  Upside is almost anywhere you go will be delicious and the restaurants are all clean."
West Village_93e66594-8bde-4c18-b448-74d6946f53be,"I put okay because if you live in this neighborhood and are lucky to live in a brownstone then your life is much easier.  Otherwise many of the apartments in the area are very old and because the neighborhood is so desired landlords have renovated them to half the size to create more studios and make the building more profitable.  Rent is outrageous here and if I have a couple million to throw down on a brownstone or condo they are worth it, in a great area and they are fairly large also charming."
West Village_cf67fcdb-d462-4003-9b8c-5f10b043fa36,"New York City is the not place to move to if you want mountains and parks and general greenery.  There is central park and prospect park, but those both require a trip on the subway to get to.  The parks department has put in a lot of money to redo the Hudson River Park and piers and they have put in a lot of plant and grassy areas, however most of the grass is fake as it's easier to upkeep and these spots in the summer do get extremely crowded.  This area is better than most though because of the close proximity to the river parks.  The beaches are not that great Coney Island is pretty dirty and ALWAYS crowded, Rockaway in Queens is better but it sure is a trek to get to."
West Village_63596570-4cc9-439a-9299-e8637b19c02a,"Driving in the New York City is not recommended there is a lot of traffic, especially going cross town and parking on the street is pretty much a nightmare.  That being said the village is really great to walk in the streets are more narrow than most so if there are big tour groups going by it can be a little annoying to pass through and there is the occasional remnants of dog poop on the street, but it is New York and you will probably find that anywhere.  Biking is made very accessible in this area with at least 4 bike share stations in a 10 block radius that I can think of on the spot, also many of the streets have been renovated to create more space for a bike lane which is helpful.  The downsides are the small streets, traffic and parking.  Also cars don't always pay attention to the bike lanes especially if there is traffic and one lane."
West Village_87f785dd-232b-49f5-8964-819d53ea9f18,"Most of the jobs available in the area are retail or food related.  There aren't office buildings.  Most people work in other parts of Manhattan that live here, probably Midtown or Tribeca and have to commute.  Otherwise I would say most people end up freelancing because there are a lot of successful artists and actors that live here and in that case there are some great cafes like Grounded and 11th St. that are fairly quiet and have great wifi that people can work on if they need a break from their apartment."
West Village_c1cdfc1a-6ac0-46db-a138-1ab78c4e1d52,"A lot of people have been moving into the community from outside of new york and even outside of the country.  The rents are some of the most expensive in the city, many old timers that are here are only able to live here because they have rent control.  The community isn't as strong as it once was, but thats mostly because the people moving in work all the time in order to afford rent or they buy a place as a city home and live in California.  There are lots of dogs in the area though and by the river and in Washington Square park there are dog runs, so I would say over all fairly friendly.  In some of the rental's the landlords do ask for people to not have pets, but most people own or are in a condo or co-op here I would say so it's not an issue."
West Village_a2de592b-ff79-4a41-8bbc-95f13942a24b,"For all entertainment or luxury needs this neighborhood has got you covered.  Restaurants and boutiques and retail especially.  West 4th street and Hudson st for food and Bleeker st has most of peoples needs for retail."
West Village_cef82432-ff3a-4f46-9276-8be55fcf6126,"The new families moving in tend to be very health conscious because they have children, so there aren't many smokers.  In fact a health food store is moving in on my block which is representative of the food choices people care about in the neighborhood.  There are also numerous yoga studios and luxury gyms that many people utilize as well as the citi bikes and the hudson river park trails there are endless options for exercise."
West Village_7560f7c0-bea1-438f-a6c0-d2b0b0160736,"This neighborhood is a HUGE attraction for tourists, it's close to the meatpacking district where all the fashionable bars and restaurants like pastis are and an easy walk to the Chelsea market as well.  In the west village NYU makes it's home which draws students from all nationalities and they hold many events in Washington Square park available to the public.  There are also a few libraries that host movie nights and poetry circles.  Restaurants are everywhere and some of the most highly rated on Zagat are here.  It's also historical and many streets have cobble stones reminiscent of an old new york, and many streets are also not on the grid so many tourists end up getting lost, hopefully they are able to find a village native to point them in the right direction because I've even encountered native new yorkers get lost in the area if they are unfamiliar.  The parks department also hosts a lot of concert events during the summer and programs for children in the winter."
West Village_b8c401fc-9997-47c5-bdbb-fee4b0f32577,"The local governments are obsessed with tourism and spending money to bring in tourism.  This neighborhood ends up getting lots of government attention because it is such a tourist attraction and the residents are fairly wealthy.  However the police aren't always that receptive to calls and don't always come quickly."
West Village_9b64feb9-4826-42ce-a646-4aaba1e9902d,"The West Village is such an incredible neighborhood to live and grow up in.  It has changed a lot over the years, the only downside is it's rising costs that make it almost impossible to rent in.  However that being said there is lots of things to do and some of the best Italian Restaurants in the city are located in the area.  NYU is nearby so there is a great influx of students and the New School also has a few buildings in the area so there is a huge emphasis on the arts.  The neighborhood also has a great history and is integral to the beginnings of New York.  In the warm weather the Hudson river is a great place to be, and there are lots of little parks to sit in, boutiques to shop at and cafes to meet friends at or do some quiet reading.  It's a community and although there are lots of wealthy non- New Yorkers moving in there is still a local newspaper and government of old timers with rent control that aren't going anywhere until they die.  A great place to be just wish it was much more affordable."
Westchester Square_fe8627ae-53f3-48a9-8c49-ba87596ccf61,"The community is family/pet friendly.  There are many families living in my neighborhood along with many extended families.  There are many pet owners living in the area."
Westchester Square_7e249730-df41-4fd2-86b8-21618d483d01,"Crime and safety issues aren't a great concern.  Graffiti has increased over the last five years after new residents moved into the area.  There are some incidents of adults smoking in marijuana in the park or noise pollution.  The police take care of the any issues rather quickly in the area due to small amount of incidents.  The police aren't very visible."
Westchester Square_0f7016fd-f4e8-4ee5-beeb-0e526034c582,"I have lived in my neighborhood my entire life.  My neighborhood is located in the north-eastern part of the Bronx.  It's mainly a residential area with a shopping district a few blocks away.  Residential buildings are mixed in with 2-3 family houses and a few single family homes.  For many of my early years, the area was quiet and decent.  Then about 5 years ago, the neighborhood began to change.  The change was slightly to the worse.  The area previously had it's young tough guys who were always hanging out at the park or on the corner but the rowdiness was minimal.  The rise in noise pollution, street garbage, and unsavory characters came when some small 3-family houses were renovated.  Low income families entered the new homes.  Unfortunately, these families brought their old habits with them.  The neighborhood experienced a rise in littering and noise pollution.  The neighborhood also saw an influx of Muslims.  I describe them by religion due to not knowing their exact country of origin of those who moved into my neighborhood.  They are visible by their traditional clothing and the women wearing burqas.  Hindus from India are also quite visible now too.  Hopefully, the area returns to the quiet and clean neighborhood it was once."
Westchester Square_d98e660f-1db3-400c-8389-e610411f659b,"The atmosphere of this area is like your typical New York City streets where you need to beware of your surroundings, friendly yet cautious, and traveling is very convenient. Although streets may be dangerous, especially at night, I would not change a thing about where I live. It has shaped me to be street smart, a better person and a better decision maker. I hope that one day, kids of future generations will try to make these streets safer, cleaner, and friendlier."

Westchester Square_27b02598-bcff-45b0-8246-a1689af7b070,"The Westchester Square section of the Bronx is up and coming. The community is vibrant and multicultural which I absolutely love. However it is really expensive to live in this section which is quite disturbing."
Westchester Square_d222775c-c14f-4499-b6ee-73a1ac72f908,"Although I do not enjoy my neighborhood, the over all location is very convenient for some one to live in. My house is relatively close to malls as well as a public library and  hospitals. It is also located right next to a highway, and if travel a little far there is the Pehlambay Park with the river as well. In addition I have buses and trains that allows me to travel to other borrows very easily."
Westchester Square_fc628dac-cb12-4dc8-bc3e-1a7c7bc12d0a,"This area is very convenient. Public transportation, laundry facilities and supermarkets are very close to where I live."

Westerleigh_7dd9c503-dad9-40e1-bc08-dddce5c86fe1,"The area you can see some people working on their health by running, jogging and walking through out the neighborhood.  Our neighborhood does not really provide an affordable  health and fitness gym.  The monthly fee for kick boxing is not really affordable.    People then rely on the walking , running and jogging  along with carrying the water bottles."
Westerleigh_aecb822b-1f2a-4cc7-8ec2-316b794b9089,"Near the area we have a few fast food areas example Burger King, Wendy's , McDonald's, which provide food in a normal pace until closing.   Pizzeria parlors are available with set time to deliver fresh pasta food example lasagna.  There are about one or two bars/nightlife in the area.  I do not know much about them.  I have not entered them due to the overcrowding that I see outside the doors.  Overall variety you  can see in the neighborhood."
Westerleigh_4265755f-32a4-48ee-a727-a49e1f2c66c6,"Public transportation is available with different options for everyone  meaning only buses travel on the street.   No train available.  Numerous shops have numerous parking lots available  for everyone.   The major problem i do see is traffic congestion due the over crowding of homes being built and construction on the expressway.  This will cause motorist to get off the expressway and travel through the neighborhoods looking for short cuts.  This congestion causes back ups and sometimes yelling in the streets.

Westerleigh_e57096ff-b95c-4c3c-a90f-884bed8ca184,"There is a mixture of different stores in the neighborhood.  Most of the stores are guided for the family to enter  and purchase within reasonable  means.   Even though the area has been subjected to stores closing due to the economy reasons.  Others stores have been striving to stay open by providing quality, quantity, one to one customer service, concerns, values, affordable prices."
Westerleigh_158f5009-f1ac-4290-b2c7-4fdf12b97bd5,"The area is family  based.    Neighbors knowing each other and working together in time of need.  Need meaning when we had the bad snow storm and no one could enter the neighborhoods or streets to help us, we were put into the hands of helping each other out. This is called unity with your neighbors."
Whitestone_7b79b4b8-9e70-4077-83c2-f7d7004b9a7a,"I lived in Whitestone for all of my 22 years, in the same house in fact. The neighborhood is extremely family friendly, I live a block away from the elementary school I attended as a child and now my mother and grandmother work there. The town of Whitestone is becoming more diverse and it truly seems like a mini mixing pot within the bigger mixing pot of Queens. I've rarely ever heard about any violence going on in Whitestone from nieghbors or even on the news/paper. I used to work in a Real Estate office in the town over from Whitestone and we did a lot of business in Whitestone. The market is very active in Whitestone, the houses are quite pricey now so it is definitely a sellers market. I am currently working in Whitestone, 5 minutes from my house. The only down side is there is not a lot of nightlife. The village has bars but it is for an older crowd."
Whitestone_b8940df3-7943-496d-a6c9-4480a27b687e,"I have lived in Whitestone all my life and being from NYC, I have seen many neighborhoods. No neighborhood, in my eyes, can even compare to Whitestone. The community is so close-knit and the people here are friendly. There are great resources such as parks and the schools in this zone are great."
Whitestone_660c866e-e989-4b73-bdf0-cdb59e0f712c,"Love how close and convenient everything is. You can find anything you need without traveling too far.  Little Bay park is a great place to go biking or running they even have a dog park for your furry friends. Whitestone is also home to the famous Cherry Valley and Cristina's Deli. Great place to bring up a family and have a home."
Whitestone_bec3f6e3-83f1-4938-8c52-ce6657fee304,"Neighborhood has nice scenery and is quiet. Friendly neighbors. Need to take transportation or have a car to get to places, therefore it is sometimes inconvenient."
Whitestone_45a643a0-dfde-48fe-bd3d-72497debcc8e,"Whitestone is a family oriented community. It is safe for your children to play outside and not have to worry about them, but you still need to keep your eye on them of coarse. On a nice day you can drive down any street and see kids playing. The school district is one of the best in the borough but unfortunately there is no high school available to the residents.  I would love to raised my children here but the real estate is way to high. Even when the 2008 real estate bubble burst Whitestone real estate still stayed status quo. One thing that I would change is the ability to build some affordable housing so more people could live in this great town."
Whitestone_f6777d63-15dd-470b-a84f-1c114ca8b81c,"It's definitely improved over the years, as has the public school system. Public transit is always close by."
Whitestone_f2873813-5408-4a86-a85b-35487c9e82b8,"Whitestone is a quite and family oriented neighborhood in Queens. It's minutes away from two major bridges in the boroughs, and many expressways. Public transportation is easily accessible and you can get into the city with 25-30 minutes."
Whitestone_32019859-c1af-43cf-8916-34e4794f5df0,"Whitestone, Queens is an amazing neighborhood to live in at face value.  I enjoy the small stores that are around and I like that the neighborhood is very quiet.  What I would change is the lack of drug support programs nearby, as well as lack of 'sober houses' for those who want to remain in a support house after rehabilitation programs.  There is terrible epidemic of drug involvement that has lead to many deaths in all age groups over the past few yeas."

Whitestone_7507dd02-811b-4278-8a6e-0f0f3f4d7ee5,"I would choose to live here again because its a nice atmosphere and hometown suburb feel without actually having to live in the suburbs far from the city. Its diverse and can accommodate anyone."
Whitestone_f8dacf68-b75b-44e2-8686-bad5398f65ca,"This is a pretty nice place to live. Houses are expensive, the roads aren't always in the best shape, and it can be difficult to find local activities to do. The positives outweigh the negatives though because crime isn't over abundant, good food is everywhere, and local transportation is great."

Whitestone_6d17645d-9eee-4df5-9817-a033d6643504,"Expensive, but not as much as the city. Pretty great to live if you can afford it in the suburbs and just make the commute."
Whitestone_219ec2a1-cc54-4d9d-90bc-fbee176d1f24,"Nothing much to do here. It's a good place, but if you're in town for a few days, its best to go to the city and not the suburbs where there's less memorable things to do"
Whitestone_d9bd9c14-7c24-49c2-b895-bcac52a2b6fe,"It's not really a community per se but the suburbs have their own network of people mostly families who meet each other through their children attending the same school and being friends. People live here their entire lives as well as their children. Very pet friendly and family friendly. Great place to raise a family"
Whitestone_762b743b-f1b8-4b4c-ab7f-59a5ac32fbab,"I've never felt unsafe here. Everything is quiet, clean, and although you'll hear ambulances, its new york city so you'll be used to it. But overall, absolutely no crime. Very safe here"

Williamsbridge_7bcee07b-6de7-4e41-aeb3-a647fc55f8c1,"There are many public schools as well as a few Catholic Private Schools so deciding on a school for your children is easy.  The neighborhood is generally safe, have not heard a gunshot yet unlike Newark, NJ, my previous neighborhood.  Nightlife is a bit bland, a few bars around but no big clubs if you wanna hit a dance floor.  Real Estate is high, there are always many houses for sale as well as apartments for rent.  Lots of Jamaican food which I love, I have spotted also a Dominican restaurant if your feeling spanish flavors.  Not to many Job opportunities aside from entry level jobs.  Commute can be rather long on the train, expect contraction on train tracks, delays on weekends and sometimes transferring from train to a shuttle bus to reach the city.  1-1 1/2 hour train commute from the city."

For a 99 cents store or a restaurant, prospective employees do not have to present any form of school leaving diplomas or certificates.   However, for teachers and other professions like nurses, one has to be certified by the state and has a degree.  For this, the market is very competitive."

Great for families and young people to hang out shop. Now also have a whole foods market branch which is just amazing ! everything is developing I just wish it was less expansive to I can move back there:)"

Williamsburg_eff6206e-23ef-46de-8b7b-679fba96ed9b,"Since I was born, I have not moved from my neighborhood at all. First of all, there are two bodegas that I cannot live without. If I want ice cream in the middle of winter and the bodega is open, then all I got to do is make a corner on the same block and there it is. On top of that, it's very peaceful and serene to walk or even sit on the steps and take on the scenery that even the birds are not that scared to approach you. However, gentrification has increased the rent to an absurd amount that the former residents can't even afford. Due to that, all of the tenants, who were Hispanic, in the apartment that I live in were evicted. Now, the current tenants are white and are upper class. The landlord did tried to evict my family, but there is no way my family and I are leaving this apartment due to the cost and also to spite her. Other than that, the neighborhood became a bit more safer to walk to even at night. That is all."
Williamsburg_12fc1633-9503-49cc-b3a4-9d711cdbbf82,"It was the 23rd April 2011, the day that I arrived in New York. I learned quite soon New Yorkers move as often as they do their groceries and so did I.

I hopped from the LES, to Midtown. From Midtown to Greenpoint and then to Williamsburg. From the moment I arrived in Williamsburg I said, 'this is wear I'm going to stay.' I can call myself a happy resident of the borough of Williamsburg for about 3 years now already.

What I love about Williamsburg are the low rise buildings, the cozy restaurants which are so enjoyable in every single season. The short walk to the water, with our amazing view over the city. I love my grocery store Harvest Market.  Williamsburgs' crowd is creative, open minded and very friendly. 

My happy moments are the moment I get my coffee at Caprices by Sophie, nights at the bar of Mogador with my roommates and when I just sit down at the pier next to the water. Those are the moments that I realize, this is where I belong."

The prevalence of crime would be a crime committed every 5-6 months. For this reason I believe that is why I feel a lack of police presence here. The only concern that I have are the noise complaints since the police in my neighborhood don't really enforce the law to the extent. The only time I have seen the police do about noise are silent the ice cream trucks that stay in my block with the music playing at around 9pm"

That's not to say that there are zero new buildings around but I would say only 15% are brand new residences with amenities like intercoms, new glass doors or lobbies. So many houses are unkempt or just vacant. And yet, housing reaches the $2000s because this is a trendier place to live as the days go by.

They are less visible. Other than that, the only real jobs I see around my immediate neighborhood are delivery boys or counter service at local delis. You have to go to Manhattan to get the full roster of great employment and even then it is difficult to achieve a job you both WANT and are paid well to do. This is an American problem not just where I live. Though my outlook is pretty good, most people work retail or have side jobs to stay afloat. I can't speak to what everyone does."

There is only one gym nearby and it is cheap though not in a very great area and dilapidated (Planet Fitness). Local gourmet delis and organic grocery stores are plentiful and have amazing produce, though are somewhat expensive, but I like to support the families who make the effort before shopping at bigger supermarkets. There are also family owned bakeries and specialty shops like yoga studios and vintage stores but not very many. I wish there were more national drugstores (there is one Walgreens 3 blocks away) and banks with ATMS (Bank of America). I don't know of any Bank of Americas nearby. There should also be more new, clean laundromats and bars popping up to replace some of the struggling furniture and travel agencies I never see being put to use."

Windsor Terrace_f74da0ed-79fb-4d7d-bab3-09940d8934bb,"Love this neighborhood, from all of the closeness it fosters to the way the leaves change colour in the autumn. Has a more suburban feel with the convenience of living in the city."

What I noticed was that there is not enough street lights in the street where I live in and it makes me feel unsafe to walk home at night. However, in Jamaica avenue  where the nightlife is very much alive, it is interesting how there are a lot of businesses that can cater to the needs of the residents at all times."
Woodhaven_2b0283c9-6653-420d-b702-cf7fc14bbb2f,"I grew up here and i love it here.  Over the years i do some changes and not for the better.  There seems to be alot more people and more populated in this are which sounds good of course.  But in reality,  its become more dangerous and don't even get me started on the parking.  I spend around 30 minutes daily looking for parking past 9pm.  There are alot of pros about the area in general like everything being within walking distance.  Overall, this is my home."
Woodhaven_0ad3b2a3-41c6-4764-8ee0-250daf4f0dcf,"I've lived in this neighborhood for all 24 years of my life. It's a beautiful neighborhood with a huge park surrounding it (Forest Park). What I like most about my neighborhood is the accessibility to many types of public transportation, the shopping area, and the beach is only a 25 minute bus ride away."
Woodhaven_50b48e6b-782e-4948-90a9-046085699e25,"There are plenty of trees in this area, hardly any free parking and the Train overhead is loud on Jamaica avenue"
Woodhaven_75d4e2af-e0fd-4165-8bd9-4019cfc90dc4,"I like living here, it's very diverse and an easy commute to Manhattan and Brooklyn. The only things I don't like are the buses and the littering. The streets are very dirty around here and it's embarrassing. The buses are never on time and it is extremely frustrating. "
Woodhaven_66b59206-4370-4fe5-b5b4-fa295e0bf49d,"It is not a bad neighborhood it is rather quiet but there is a main avenue in which one can find everything they need and public transportation is easy to reach."
Woodhaven_ef8b84f5-53eb-4581-aa98-c49820010fa6,"Woodhaven is a nice neighborhood. It has a beautiful park to enjoy a nice walk or jog. There are stores open for 24 hours, schools close by and the J train only a few blocks away (depending on where you live). It has many schools and restaurants with all kinds of cuisines. "
Woodhaven_2c052e02-f192-4ad3-b487-928514120175,"This neighborhood allows you great opportunities throughout the day. The neighborhood is very quite during the day and parks located throughout the neighborhoods allows the kids in the neighborhood places to go. "
Woodhaven_d83d1369-570a-49bd-89a7-cfb957c0f5c2,"Loud neighborhood with either your local neighbors or cars driving around and blasting music.  Large Latino population, racism existing if you're 'Chino'.  Some parts are friendly, others are not so nice.  Feels dangerous at night but they recently installed brighter streetlights.  Lots of small and large supermarkets around as well as plenty of nail salons, and barber shops.   The schools I attended here had a large Latino population and was thus discriminate any white, blacks, or Asians.  "

There are sometimes police cars around to watch the area as well so I have never felt like I was in danger."
Woodhaven_f6f3a312-4ac7-4a8a-9d35-4464eedc62e6,"The area in which I live in is a homely area that has absolutely everything that you need. Supermarkets, laundromats, restaurants, school, easy access to transportation; both trains and buses, and even a doctor's office, makes this an ideal area to live in. There aren't many other cities or states in which you can find all of these facilities. The future of this area also seems to be prosperous because it was not the best neighborhood before about 10 years ago with lots of fights. The social aspect has greatly improved so I'm sure that there's nothing but success ahead for this area."

Woodhaven_76cb8abe-6b05-4f5f-9979-60db9f05a049,"It's an okay place to live, my neighbors are friendly but only because we have known them for so many years. I hate that there is never any parking around where I live because of congestion and no garages or driveways."
Woodhaven_8e191f94-9d8e-4456-95d2-acf07938ee9d,"The general atmosphere of this neighborhood is laidback and peaceful. It's not a particularly busy area but there are still nice places to visit and go shopping. I would live here again if I had to do it all over."
Woodhaven_9347f917-8115-4612-8528-8cae1ac3b616,"The neighborhood it self is okay, there is a bump sign and cars still pass by pretty fast which is not safe due to people walking/ crossing the street."

I liked that it has a small town feel within the parameters of a big metropolitan city.  If I could change something I think it would be to add more healthy food options or even a Starbucks!"
Woodlawn_db9e8919-8830-4ddc-8c8f-e6908ad60839,"Woodlawn is patrolled by the 47 precinct, most of the cops are from the area as well so they sometimes let kids slide for certain things because they were once the same age."
Woodlawn_4906ee20-82b4-4ba5-ba70-65472c619f45,"Woodlawn is a real nice area to live in. Most of the children go to Public School 19 on Katonah avenue for their grammar and middle school, and head else where for high school. For the teenagers, there are several Catholic High Schools around the area, both all boys/girls and co-ed. For the adults, commuting to Manhattan, or anywhere really, is easy thanks to the express buses that go to midtown, the local buses that go around the Bronx, the subways, and the Metro North Railroad"

Woodside_11f87efc-816c-4445-8a14-d6523b3b0fe3,"I have been living in Woodside for over 10 years. From personal experiences, I think that Woodside is one of the greatest places to live in. I have traveled from various locations, and this neighborhood is by far the safest. With close access to train and buses. One of the most notable things about this neighborhood is its diversity in restaurants and people. There are great restaurants including Don Pollo, Paris Baguette, Fresh Taco, Byrani House, Yum Yum, and more."
Woodside_2c386725-b006-4361-8203-27c26162a201,"a Great diverse neighborhood, off the 7 line that takes 20 mins to the city. Quite and safe, great for families and working adults."

Located only 20 minutes away from Manhattan, you are able to go explore the city during the day and be back home for supper. Speaking of food, you have various options to choose from. There is a Filipino mini-mart, the Korean H-Mart, Key-food, and big brand supermarkets. If you do not want to cook, then enjoy the various restaurants located throughout the area. 

Woodside also has various parks for children and outdoor fields. You will often see these parks filled with families all day long. The area is also part of a thriving public school district. If you want to undertake religious activities, there are various churches of different religions. Many of them offer services in different languages and are open to new members. 

Overall, if you are looking for a suburban neighborhood that is family friendly, safe, and diverse, then Woodside is the right neighborhood for you."
Woodside_2dcab541-6ae2-4704-8c08-9f2c114f19c1,"Woodside is a nice area if you are looking to step up to a location that is affordable and a short commute to the city. The amenities include lots of great food, and a family focused community. It is a safe place to live even if working until late at night. There are many different options for grocery stores with specializations in different cultures. I enjoy the Asian grocery store. Parking is free and there is also an option of garage rental for added safety. In my apartment building we have our own parking lot. My neighbors are kind and are always busy living the busy NY lifestyle."
Woodside_961492c1-2277-4ad2-b1ec-51f395099260,"I like the many restaurants in Woodside, my favorite being the thai restaurants found on Woodside ave. To improve Woodside, I would add a recreation center to be available to all residents."
Woodside_bd5fcee6-4e7e-47d8-ba79-877a3d38692e,"I am currently living in Woodside and have nothing very terrible to say about the neighborhood.  For the most part it is safe; however, ever since the Pan American Hotel on Queens Blvd has become a homeless shelter, I find that many residents in Woodside fear walking the streets when it gets dark.  The neighborhood is family friendly as there are many children and a nice park by the Big Six.  There is also a fairly new dog park right near the BQE exit on the boulevard.  One of the most convenient things about this neighborhood is that the 7 train stops on Roosevelt and 61st Street.  As many know, the 7 train stops at many popular stations: Main Street, Citi Field, Junction Blvd., 61st/Woodside, 46th/Bliss, Queens Borough Plaza, 59th/Lexington, Grand Central, 5th Avenue, Times Square, just to name a few."

Neighborhood is very friendly if you are a part of the community."
Woodside_2f73c8c2-1aff-48e9-82d8-b26f458770e9,"Woodside is a beautiful but small city. the most populations are Latins but some Indies and Asian also. No to many high buldings."
Woodside_9c7f14dc-14b3-4c88-9d47-962ede27d915,"If you want to escape from the craziness of Manhattan, Woodside is a wonderful place to live in. People who want to live in safe, quiet and pay affordable housing prices, Woodside should be in their list. It is a working and middle -class residential where cheap, fast and convenient transportation make life a lot easier. Woodside embraces, welcomes and unites people from different ethnicities. There are plenty of attracting places to visit during leisure time for people to lower their stress and enjoy the beauty of Mother Nature including Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Rock-away Beach and Citi Field for sports. The big problem facing this neighborhood is having few resources such as recreational activities and parks for children to express their talents."
Woodside_59e57051-a8c7-4f34-a0c4-4b0c3b26bd55,"Great community.  St. Sebastian School alumna great school, amazing teachers. Small community where everyone knows each other. Community events are amazing and fun."

Woodside_84f3c973-74ea-4cbf-b92e-06468d3ce826,"The atmosphere is generally peaceful, and there are subways that are easily accessible. In terms of potential improvements, there could be more variety of stores, and more law enforcement buildings nearby (like police stations)."
Woodside_5d3713ce-1886-4835-9364-d64c9a652a53,"It is a relatively a safe place to live in, except we don't see police much in my area, especially at nights. Recently there was say of a rapist that was roaming in the Woodside/Sunnyside area and I am not sure if he was caught yet or not. Since I arrive home at night I am always scared of someone assaulting me. I just wish there was more communication between the police dept. and the community or at the very least, more police around the area."
Woodside_4d4f963c-a63f-405d-93a1-fc2840742cca,"I really like living in this area. It's quiet but not too quiet. It's not too crowded with people during the day and the neighbors are just friendly with each other. I also love the amount of diversity that can be found in my neighborhood. there are people from many different backgrounds and religions and the way that we can all come together is amazing in itself. However at nights it can be a bit difficult to manage walking around the neighborhood. Now it doesn't have a bad reputation but I have heard of many criminals that roam through my area and since it is quiet near where I live it is worse. Very few people are in the streets at night and although I feel fairly safe, I still know about the criminals that roam around in the nights near my neighborhood."
